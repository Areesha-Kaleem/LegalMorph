The court dismissed the review applications, affirming that the Amnesty Order applied to all cases where death sentences were confirmed by the High Court before its notification, irrespective of pending appeals in the Supreme Court. The judgment emphasized the unambiguous language of the Amnesty Order and rejected the Advocate-General's contention that the Supreme Court was not an 'ordinary criminal court' under the Order."
