The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in a landmark judgment dated January 9, 2024, addressed the constitutionality of trying civilians in military courts under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (Army Act). This decision arose from a series of petitions filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, challenging the trial of civilians for offenses allegedly committed during the events of May 9 and 10, 2023. The case was titled *Jawwad S. Khawaja vs. Federation of Pakistan, etc.* (Constitution Petition Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 30 of 2023).

### Key Issues:
1. **Constitutionality of Sections 2(1)(d) and 59(4) of the Army Act**: These provisions allowed civilians to be tried by military courts for specific offenses, including those under the Official Secrets Act, 1923.
2. **Fundamental Rights**: The petitioners argued that these provisions violated the fundamental right to a fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution, as well as Articles 9 (security of person) and 25 (equality before the law).
3. **Jurisdiction of Military Courts**: The petitioners contended that civilians should be tried in ordinary criminal courts established under Article 175 of the Constitution, not military courts.

### Judgment:
The Court, by a majority of 4-1, declared Sections 2(1)(d) and 59(4) of the Army Act unconstitutional and of no legal effect. Justice Yahya Afridi dissented on the issue of constitutionality but agreed with the majority on other points.

#### Majority Opinion:
1. **Violation of Fundamental Rights**: The Court held that the trial of civilians by military courts violated Article 10A, which guarantees the right to a fair trial and due process. Military courts lack the independence and procedural safeguards required for a fair trial, including the right to a reasoned judgment and an independent appellate forum.
2. **Scope of Article 8(3)(a)**: The Court rejected the government's argument that Article 8(3)(a) of the Constitution, which exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the application of fundamental rights, could extend to civilians. The Court clarified that this exemption applies only to members of the armed forces and laws directly related to their discipline and duties.
3. **Legislative Competence**: While acknowledging that Parliament has the legislative competence to enact laws for the armed forces, the Court emphasized that such laws must comply with constitutional guarantees, including fundamental rights.
4. **Historical Context**: The Court distinguished the present case from earlier precedents, including *Brig. (Rtd.) F.B. Ali v. State* (PLD 1975 SC 506), noting that the constitutional landscape had significantly evolved with the inclusion of Article 10A in 2010.

#### Dissenting Opinion (Justice Yahya Afridi):
Justice Afridi agreed that the 103 civilians detained in connection with the May 9-10 events should be tried in ordinary criminal courts. However, he did not find the impugned provisions of the Army Act unconstitutional, citing the binding precedent of *F.B. Ali* and the need for a larger bench to revisit the issue.

### Implications:
1. **Civilians to Be Tried in Ordinary Courts**: The Court directed that all civilians, including the 103 individuals detained for the May 9-10 incidents, must be tried in ordinary criminal courts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, or other applicable laws.
2. **Past Convictions**: The Court declared that convictions of civilians by military courts under the now-invalidated provisions would remain unaffected if they had already been finalized or served.
3. **Future Legislative Action**: The judgment underscores the need for any future legislation involving military jurisdiction over civilians to comply strictly with constitutional safeguards.

### Conclusion:
This judgment reaffirms the supremacy of the Constitution and the fundamental rights enshrined therein, particularly the right to a fair trial. It marks a significant step in ensuring judicial independence and the separation of powers, emphasizing that civilians cannot be subjected to military trials in violation of their constitutional rights.

**Summary of the Case: Constitution Petition Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 30 of 2023**

**Background:**  
The petitions challenged the trial of civilians under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, following violent incidents on May 9 and 10, 2023, which included attacks on military installations. The petitioners argued that such trials violated fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, particularly the right to a fair trial (Article 10A), and sought a declaration that certain provisions of the Army Act were unconstitutional.

**Key Provisions Challenged:**  
1. **Section 2(1)(d):** This provision subjects civilians to military trials if accused of seducing military personnel or committing offenses under the Official Secrets Act, 1923, related to defense establishments.  
2. **Section 59(4):** Allows civilians accused under Section 2(1)(d) to be tried as if they were subject to the Army Act.

**Arguments:**  
- **Petitioners:**  
  - Civilians cannot be tried by military courts as it violates their fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial (Article 10A) and the independence of the judiciary (Article 175).  
  - Military courts lack impartiality and procedural safeguards, such as reasoned judgments and independent appellate forums.  
  - Article 8(3)(a), which exempts laws related to armed forces from fundamental rights, applies only to military personnel, not civilians.  
  - The trial of civilians in military courts creates a parallel judicial system, contrary to the Constitution.  

- **Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP):**  
  - Defended the provisions as constitutional, citing the precedent set in *F.B. Ali v. State (PLD 1975 SC 506)*, which upheld the trial of civilians under the Army Act if the offense had a "nexus" with the defense of Pakistan.  
  - Argued that the impugned sections were protected under Article 8(3)(a) and were necessary for national security.  
  - Asserted that military courts provide adequate procedural safeguards.

**Judgment:**  
The Supreme Court, with a majority of 4-1, declared the challenged provisions unconstitutional. Justice Yahya Afridi dissented on the issue of the provisions' constitutionality but agreed that the civilians involved in the May 9 and 10 incidents should be tried by ordinary criminal courts.

**Key Findings:**  
1. **Violation of Fundamental Rights:**  
   - The provisions of Section 2(1)(d) and Section 59(4) were found to violate Article 10A (right to a fair trial) and Article 175 (independence of the judiciary).  
   - Military courts lack the procedural safeguards required for a fair trial, such as impartiality, reasoned judgments, and independent appellate forums.

2. **Applicability of Article 8(3)(a):**  
   - The Court held that Article 8(3)(a) applies only to laws concerning military personnel and their discipline, not civilians.  
   - Extending military jurisdiction to civilians undermines their constitutional protections.

3. **Precedent in *F.B. Ali v. State*:**  
   - The Court distinguished the present case from *F.B. Ali*, noting that the latter did not address the fundamental right to a fair trial under Article 10A, which was introduced in 2010.  
   - The Court emphasized that the constitutional landscape had evolved, requiring stricter adherence to fundamental rights.

4. **Trial of Civilians:**  
   - The Court directed that the 103 civilians detained in connection with the May 9 and 10 incidents be tried by ordinary criminal courts under the relevant laws.  
   - Any ongoing proceedings under the Army Act against these civilians were declared void.

**Dissenting Opinion (Justice Yahya Afridi):**  
- Justice Afridi upheld the constitutionality of the impugned provisions based on the precedent set in *F.B. Ali*.  
- However, he agreed that the civilians involved in the May 9 and 10 incidents did not meet the criteria for trial under Section 2(1)(d)(ii) and should be tried by ordinary courts.

**Conclusion:**  
The Supreme Court invalidated Sections 2(1)(d) and 59(4) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952, as unconstitutional and directed that civilians accused in the May 9 and 10 incidents be tried in ordinary criminal courts. The judgment reaffirmed the supremacy of fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary.

This case involves critical constitutional and procedural issues before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, primarily addressing the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights, the principles of federalism, and the constitutionality of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. Below is a summary of the key points, arguments, and judicial observations:

---

### **1. Principles on Admissibility of Evidence (JC56 Case):**
The court reiterated the following principles regarding evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights:
- **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving the admissibility of evidence.
- **Unconstitutionality:** If evidence is alleged to have been obtained unconstitutionally, the prosecution must prove either (a) no violation occurred, or (b) the evidence remains admissible despite the breach.
- **Deliberate Violations:** Evidence obtained through deliberate and conscious constitutional violations should generally be excluded unless exceptional circumstances exist.
- **Presumption of Exclusion:** Evidence obtained in breach of constitutional rights is presumed inadmissible unless the breach was inadvertent or arose from subsequent legal developments.
- **State of Mind Analysis:** Determining whether a breach was deliberate requires examining the conduct and intent of both the individual gathering the evidence and senior officials responsible for policies.

---

### **2. Federalism and Judicial Autonomy:**
The court addressed the constitutional framework of federalism and the autonomy of High Courts:
- **High Court Independence:** High Courts are constitutionally empowered to supervise subordinate courts and operate independently of the Supreme Court, except in appellate matters.
- **Role of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP):** The Constitution does not grant the CJP supervisory authority over High Courts. Federalism demands that High Courts function autonomously.
- **Supreme Court's Appellate Role:** The Supreme Court's decisions are binding on all courts, including High Courts, but its jurisdiction is appellate, not supervisory.
- **Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023:** Section 3 of the Act requires matters invoking the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution to first be examined by a committee. This provision was disregarded in the present case, raising concerns about procedural compliance.

---

### **3. Procedural Concerns and Bench Composition:**
- **Non-Consultation with Judges:** Justice Sardar Tariq Masood noted that he was not consulted before being included in the bench hearing the petitions. He expressed concerns about the practice of petitioners meeting the CJP to expedite case listings.
- **Pending Decision on the Act:** Justice Masood emphasized that the petitions challenging the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, should be decided before hearing other matters under Article 184(3). He criticized the assumption that the Act would be struck down.
- **Impact on Appeals:** Justice Masood highlighted that if the Act is struck down, the right to appeal under Section 5 of the Act would become redundant, as appeals require a larger bench that may not be feasible with the current composition of the Supreme Court.

---

### **4. Call for Full Court Bench:**
- Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah expressed reservations about the non-formation of a Full Court Bench for cases of significant public importance. He argued that collective deliberation by all judges enhances judicial legitimacy and public confidence.
- He urged that all matters under Article 184(3) be heard by a Full Court Bench until the constitutionality of the Act is resolved. However, his request for a Full Court Bench was not accepted by the CJP.

---

### **5. Broader Context and Public Interest:**
- The petitions under Article 184(3) involve alleged violations of fundamental rights and matters of public importance, including the trial of individuals accused of attacks on military and public property on May 9, 2023.
- Justice Masood emphasized that each case must be decided based on its facts and applicable law, ensuring the accused are heard before any adverse action is taken.

---

### **6. Judicial Observations on Integrity and Rule of Law:**
- Justice Shah underscored the importance of preserving the integrity of the judiciary and adhering to constitutional principles, including the right to life, liberty, dignity, due process, and fair trial.
- Both Justices Masood and Shah criticized the procedural irregularities and lack of consultation in the bench formation and case listing.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The case raises significant constitutional questions about judicial independence, procedural fairness, and the balance of powers between the Supreme Court and High Courts. The judges emphasized the need for adherence to constitutional principles, proper bench composition, and respect for the autonomy of High Courts. The pending decision on the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, remains central to resolving procedural disputes in the case.
