The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled on the constitutionality of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 ("the Act") in a case involving multiple petitions challenging the Act. The petitions were filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, which allows the Supreme Court to address questions of public importance concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights.

### Background:
The Act aimed to regulate the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court, including provisions for the constitution of benches, exercise of original jurisdiction under Article 184(3), and granting a right of appeal against decisions under Article 184(3). The Act also sought to limit the discretionary powers of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) in constituting benches and invoking suo motu jurisdiction.

### Key Provisions of the Act:
1. **Section 2**: Established a three-member Committee (comprising the CJP and the two most senior judges) to decide the constitution of benches.
2. **Section 3**: Required matters invoking original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) to be first examined by the Committee.
3. **Section 4**: Mandated that cases involving constitutional interpretation be heard by benches of at least five judges.
4. **Section 5**: Created a right of intra-court appeal against orders under Article 184(3), both prospectively and retrospectively.
5. **Section 6**: Allowed parties to appoint counsel of their choice for filing review petitions.
6. **Section 7**: Required urgent applications to be fixed for hearing within 14 days.
7. **Section 8**: Gave the Act overriding effect over other laws, rules, and judgments.

### Judgment:
The Supreme Court issued a split decision on the constitutionality of the Act:

1. **Constitutionality of the Act**: By a majority of 10-5, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, except for Section 5(2).
2. **Prospective Right of Appeal (Section 5(1))**: By a majority of 9-6, the Court upheld the provision granting a prospective right of appeal.
3. **Retrospective Right of Appeal (Section 5(2))**: By a narrow majority of 8-7, the Court declared the retrospective right of appeal unconstitutional.

### Majority Opinion:
The majority held that the Act was within Parliament's legislative competence under Article 191 of the Constitution, which allows the Supreme Court to make rules "subject to the Constitution and law." They interpreted "law" to include statutory law enacted by Parliament. The majority also found that the Act enhanced transparency and judicial independence by limiting the unilateral powers of the CJP.

However, the retrospective right of appeal under Section 5(2) was deemed unconstitutional as it disrupted the finality of past judicial decisions and violated principles of legal certainty.

### Minority Opinion:
The dissenting judges argued that the Act infringed on the independence of the judiciary and the principle of separation of powers. They contended that Article 191 exclusively empowers the Supreme Court to regulate its practice and procedure, and Parliament lacks the authority to legislate on this subject. They also criticized the Act for undermining the CJP's role as "master of the roster" and for interfering with the Court's internal functioning.

### Key Legal Issues:
1. **Legislative Competence**: Whether Parliament could legislate on the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court under Article 191 and the Federal Legislative List (Entry 55 and 58).
2. **Judicial Independence**: Whether the Act compromised the independence of the judiciary by subjecting its internal procedures to legislative control.
3. **Right of Appeal**: Whether the creation of an intra-court appeal against decisions under Article 184(3) required a constitutional amendment.

### Conclusion:
The Supreme Court upheld most of the Act, emphasizing its alignment with constitutional principles and the need for transparency in judicial processes. However, it struck down the retrospective appeal provision as unconstitutional. The decision reflects a nuanced balance between judicial independence and legislative oversight.

2. **Prospective Right of Appeal (Section 5(1)):** By a majority of 9-6, the provision granting a prospective right of appeal was upheld.
3. **Retrospective Right of Appeal (Section 5(2)):** By a majority of 8-7, the retrospective right of appeal was declared unconstitutional.

**Majority Opinion:**
- **Legislative Competence:** The majority held that Parliament was competent to legislate on the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court under Article 191 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court's rule-making power is "subject to the Constitution and law." They interpreted "law" to include statutory law enacted by Parliament.
- **Independence of Judiciary:** The Act was deemed to enhance judicial transparency and independence by introducing a collegial system for bench formation and regulating suo motu powers.
- **Right of Appeal:** The prospective right of appeal was upheld as a necessary procedural safeguard, but the retrospective application was found to violate constitutional principles of finality and vested rights.

**Dissenting Opinions:**
- **Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Others:** The dissenting Judges argued that Article 191 exclusively grants the Supreme Court the authority to regulate its practice and procedure, and Parliament's intervention through the Act infringes upon judicial independence and violates the principle of separation of powers. They also contended that the Act undermines the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, which have constitutional backing.
- **Justice Shahid Waheed:** He emphasized that the Act disrupts the judiciary's autonomy and creates procedural anomalies, particularly in Sections 2, 3, and 4. He held that the retrospective right of appeal under Section 5(2) was unconstitutional and that the Act as a whole was ultra vires the Constitution.

**Key Legal Principles Discussed:**
1. **Separation of Powers:** The judiciary's independence and its exclusive authority to regulate its internal functioning were emphasized as fundamental to the constitutional framework.
2. **Legislative Competence:** The scope of Parliament's authority under Article 191 and Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List was debated extensively.
3. **Judicial Independence:** The Court reiterated that judicial independence is a cornerstone of the Constitution and must be safeguarded from legislative encroachment.
4. **Finality of Judgments:** The retrospective right of appeal was struck down for violating the principle of finality and creating uncertainty in past and closed transactions.

**Outcome:**
The petitions challenging the Act were dismissed, except for the retrospective right of appeal under Section 5(2), which was declared unconstitutional. The Act remains in force, subject to the exclusion of Section 5(2).

### **Key Issue**:
The constitutionality of the **Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 (PAPA)** was challenged on the grounds that it undermines the independence of the judiciary and interferes with the Supreme Court's functioning, which is essential to uphold the Constitution of Pakistan.

---

### **Arguments**:

1. **Petitioners**:
   - Argued that PAPA violates the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, particularly Articles 175(2), 184, and 189.
   - Claimed that PAPA imposes procedural constraints on the Supreme Court, hindering its ability to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction effectively.
   - Asserted that the Act is ultra vires (beyond the powers) of the Constitution.

2. **Respondents**:
   - Defended PAPA as a legislative measure aimed at regulating judicial procedures to ensure transparency and accountability.
   - Argued that the Act does not encroach upon judicial independence but rather facilitates better functioning of the judiciary.

---

### **Judgment**:

1. **Declaration of Unconstitutionality**:
   - The Supreme Court declared the **Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 (PAPA)** **ultra vires** the Constitution, holding that it interferes with the judiciary's independence and the Supreme Court's ability to function freely and efficiently.
   - The Court emphasized that judicial independence is a cornerstone of the Constitution and cannot be compromised by legislative overreach.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - **Separation of Powers**: The Court reiterated that the Constitution mandates a clear separation between the judiciary and the executive (Article 175(2)). Any law that disrupts this balance is unconstitutional.
   - **Judicial Independence**: The Court cited precedents, including *Baz Muhammad Kakar v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2012 SC 923)* and *Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry v. President of Pakistan (PLD 2010 SC 61)*, to underscore the judiciary's autonomy as a fundamental principle of governance.
   - **Supreme Court's Rule-Making Power**: The Court noted that the Constitution (Article 191) grants the Supreme Court the authority to make its own procedural rules. PAPA's provisions, which sought to regulate these procedures, were deemed an unconstitutional encroachment on this power.

3. **Islamic Principles**:
   - The judgment also referenced Islamic jurisprudence, emphasizing that justice must remain free from external influences. The Court cited Quranic verses and Islamic scholars like Abul A’la Maududi and Al-Qurtubi to support the principle of judicial independence.

### **Conclusion**:
The Supreme Court allowed the petitions challenging PAPA and declared the Act unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that any law restricting the judiciary's independence or interfering with its constitutional mandate to safeguard the Constitution cannot be sustained.
