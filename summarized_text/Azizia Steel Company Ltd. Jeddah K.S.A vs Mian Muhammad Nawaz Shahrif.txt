### Summary of the Legal Case: Azizia Steel Company Ltd. Jeddah K.S.A vs. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Reference No. 19/2017)

#### **Background**
The case stems from allegations of corruption and possession of assets disproportionate to known sources of income against Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, and his sons, Hussain Nawaz Sharif and Hassan Nawaz Sharif. The allegations were investigated following the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, which revealed offshore companies owned by Nawaz Sharif’s family.

#### **Key Allegations**
1. **Assets in Question**:
   - Al-Azizia Steel Company Ltd. (ASCL), Jeddah, KSA.
   - Hill Metals Establishment (HME), Jeddah, KSA.
   - Remittances totaling €1,267,568 and $10,219,155 sent by Hussain Nawaz and HME to Nawaz Sharif between 2010-2017.
   - Additional remittances to Nawaz Sharif’s daughter, Maryam Safdar, and other individuals.

2. **Failure to Justify Sources**:
   - Nawaz Sharif and his sons allegedly failed to provide a credible money trail or evidence for the acquisition and operation of these assets.
   - The prosecution argued that Hussain Nawaz acted as a "benamidar" (ostensible owner) for Nawaz Sharif, who was the actual beneficial owner.

#### **Investigation**
- **Supreme Court Orders**:
   - The Supreme Court of Pakistan directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file references based on findings from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed in 2017.
   - The JIT included representatives from FIA, NAB, SECP, SBP, ISI, and MI.
   - The JIT submitted its final report on July 10, 2017, concluding that the accused failed to justify the sources of funds for the assets.

- **Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA)**:
   - Requests were sent to UAE and KSA for verification of claims related to Gulf Steel Mills (GSM), ASCL, and HME.
   - UAE authorities confirmed that key documents submitted by the accused were fabricated, including a purported sale agreement of GSM.

#### **Prosecution Evidence**
1. **Financial Discrepancies**:
   - The combined declared wealth of Nawaz Sharif and his sons in 2001 was far below the estimated cost of establishing ASCL ($6 million) and HME ($16.827 million).
   - Remittances from HME accounted for 88% of its net profits, suggesting Nawaz Sharif was the real beneficiary.

2. **Fabricated Documents**:
   - UAE authorities confirmed that notarization records for GSM sale agreements did not exist.
   - Alleged transportation of machinery from Dubai to Jeddah for ASCL was also unsubstantiated.

3. **Statements and Admissions**:
   - Nawaz Sharif admitted receiving substantial remittances from HME but claimed they were gifts from his son out of love and affection.
   - The prosecution argued these were disguised income from assets beneficially owned by Nawaz Sharif.

#### **Defense Arguments**
1. **Denial of Ownership**:
   - Nawaz Sharif claimed no connection to ASCL or HME, stating they were owned and operated by his son, Hussain Nawaz.
   - He argued that remittances were gifts and not indicative of ownership.

2. **Challenge to JIT Findings**:
   - The defense questioned the admissibility of the JIT report and MLA responses, claiming procedural flaws and bias.

3. **Political Motivation**:
   - Nawaz Sharif alleged the case was politically motivated and based on conjecture.

#### **Court Findings**
1. **Beneficial Ownership**:
   - The court held that Nawaz Sharif was the real beneficial owner of ASCL and HME, with his son acting as a benamidar.

2. **Disproportionate Assets**:
   - The court found the value of ASCL and HME grossly disproportionate to Nawaz Sharif’s known sources of income.

3. **Presumption of Guilt**:
   - Under Section 14(c) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, the court presumed Nawaz Sharif guilty of corruption due to his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for the assets.

#### **Verdict**
- **Conviction**:
   - Nawaz Sharif was convicted under Section 9(a)(v) of NAO, 1999, for corruption and corrupt practices.
   - Sentence: 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs. 1.5 billion, and $25 million.
   - Assets of HME were ordered to be forfeited to the Federal Government.

- **Disqualification**:
   - Nawaz Sharif was disqualified from holding public office for 10 years post-release.

- **Absconding Co-Accused**:
   - Hussain Nawaz and Hassan Nawaz were declared proclaimed offenders, with perpetual non-bailable warrants issued against them.

#### **Appeal**
The court informed Nawaz Sharif of his right to appeal the judgment within 10 days.

### Summary of the Legal Case: Conviction of Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif

**Case Overview:**
This case pertains to allegations of corruption and corrupt practices against Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Accused No. 1), former Prime Minister of Pakistan, under Section 9(a)(v) of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (NAO). The charges involve the ownership of assets, including Al-Azizia Steel Company Limited (ASCL) and Hill Metals Establishment (HME), which were allegedly disproportionate to his known sources of income. The case was initiated following the Panama Papers revelations and subsequent investigations by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) constituted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Ownership of Assets:**
   - The court found that Nawaz Sharif was the true beneficial owner of ASCL and HME, despite these entities being ostensibly owned by his son, Hussain Nawaz Sharif (Accused No. 3 and a proclaimed offender). The court held that Hussain Nawaz acted as a *benamidar* (nominee) for his father.
   - The prosecution established that the assets were acquired through funds that were not accounted for and were disproportionate to the declared income of Nawaz Sharif and his family.

2. **Funding and Money Trail:**
   - The defense's claim that the funds for ASCL and HME originated from the sale of Gulf Steel Mills (GSM) and subsequent investments with the Qatari Al-Thani family was rejected as unsubstantiated. The JIT's Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requests to the UAE revealed that the purported sale agreements and money trail were fabricated.
   - The court noted that remittances from HME to Nawaz Sharif, totaling $8.91 million between 2010 and 2015, constituted over 88% of HME's net profits. These were characterized as a mechanism to transfer illicit funds under the guise of "gifts."

3. **Failure to Provide Evidence:**
   - Nawaz Sharif failed to produce credible evidence or a money trail to justify the acquisition of ASCL and HME. His defense relied on unverified claims and documents, including Qatari letters, which were deemed inadmissible and unreliable.
   - The court invoked Section 14(c) of NAO, which shifts the burden of proof to the accused to account for assets disproportionate to known sources of income. Nawaz Sharif failed to discharge this burden.

4. **Conduct of Co-Accused:**
   - Hussain Nawaz Sharif and Hassan Nawaz Sharif (Accused No. 2 and No. 3) were declared proclaimed offenders for absconding and failing to appear before the court.

**Judgment:**
1. **Conviction and Sentence:**
   - Nawaz Sharif was convicted under Section 9(a)(v) of NAO and sentenced to **7 years of rigorous imprisonment**.
   - He was fined **Rs. 1.5 billion** and **$25 million**.
   - All assets, properties, and interests in HME were ordered to be forfeited to the Federal Government.

2. **Disqualification:**
   - Nawaz Sharif was disqualified from holding public office for **10 years** following his release from imprisonment, as per Section 15 of NAO.

3. **Proclaimed Offenders:**
   - Perpetual non-bailable warrants were issued against Hussain Nawaz Sharif and Hassan Nawaz Sharif. Their names were directed to be entered into the relevant register of proclaimed offenders.

4. **Right to Appeal:**
   - Nawaz Sharif was informed of his right to appeal the judgment within 10 days under Section 32(a) of NAO.

**Legal Reasoning:**
- The court relied on the statutory presumption under Section 14(c) of NAO, which allows the court to presume guilt if the accused fails to account for assets disproportionate to known sources of income.
- The court dismissed the defense's objections regarding the admissibility of JIT findings, MLA responses, and other evidence, emphasizing that the prosecution had fulfilled its initial burden of proof.
- The court noted that the defense's shifting narratives and failure to produce credible evidence demonstrated a "guilty mind."

**Case References:**
- The court cited precedents, including **PLD 2018 SC 114**, **2013 P Cr. LJ 591**, and **2015 SCMR 710**, to establish the legal principles governing corruption cases and the burden of proof under NAO.

**Conclusion:**
The court concluded that Nawaz Sharif was guilty of corruption and corrupt practices, as he failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the acquisition of assets beyond his known sources of income. The judgment underscores the application of accountability laws to public officeholders and the importance of transparency in asset declarations.
