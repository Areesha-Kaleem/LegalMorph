### Summary of Legal Case: The State vs. Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi and Others (Reference No. 19/2023)

#### **Background**
This case revolves around allegations of corruption and misuse of authority by Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, and others. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry in July 2022, later upgraded to an investigation in April 2023. The investigation focused on the illegal diversion of £190 million (GBP) frozen by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 2002. The funds were allegedly repatriated to an account designated for Bahria Town Karachi's land payment instead of the State of Pakistan, benefiting Malik Riaz Hussain, CEO of Bahria Town.

#### **Key Allegations**
1. **Illegal Diversion of Funds**: The funds frozen by the NCA were intended for the State of Pakistan but were diverted to the Supreme Court of Pakistan's account for settling Bahria Town's liability. This diversion was allegedly facilitated by Imran Khan, Mirza Shahzad Akbar (Special Assistant to the PM), and others.
2. **Quid Pro Quo**: In exchange for this favor, Malik Riaz Hussain provided monetary benefits, including land (458 kanals) and funds (Rs. 285 million), to the Al-Qadir University Project Trust, where Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Imran, were trustees.
3. **Violation of Rules**: Imran Khan allegedly approved a note bypassing the Rules of Business, 1973, and misled the Cabinet to approve the diversion of funds without proper deliberation.
4. **Personal Gains**: Imran Khan and Bushra Imran allegedly benefited from the trust's assets, including land and funds, under the guise of donations.
5. **Role of Co-Accused**: Mirza Shahzad Akbar and others were accused of aiding and abetting the illegal transactions, including signing a Confidentiality Deed with the NCA before Cabinet approval.

#### **Key Evidence**
- **Documents**: Confidentiality Deed signed by Shahzad Akbar and Zia ul Mustafa Nasim, Cabinet meeting minutes, and trust deeds.
- **Witness Testimonies**: Statements from Cabinet members, NAB officials, and other witnesses corroborated the allegations.
- **Financial Transactions**: Evidence of land transfers and monetary donations linked to Bahria Town and the Al-Qadir University Project Trust.

#### **Defense Arguments**
- **Political Victimization**: Imran Khan claimed the case was part of a broader campaign of political harassment, with over 250 cases filed against him since his removal from office.
- **Good Faith**: The defense argued that the Cabinet acted in good faith and approved the transactions to avoid prolonged litigation in the UK.
- **No Personal Gain**: Imran Khan and Bushra Imran denied receiving any personal benefits from the trust or the transactions.

#### **Court Findings**
1. **Misuse of Authority**: Imran Khan and Shahzad Akbar misused their positions to divert public funds for private benefit.
2. **Violation of Rules**: The Cabinet's approval process violated the Rules of Business, 1973, and lacked transparency.
3. **Personal Gains**: The court found sufficient evidence of personal benefits derived by Imran Khan and Bushra Imran through the trust's assets.
4. **Quid Pro Quo**: The court concluded that the donations and land transfers were part of a quid pro quo arrangement benefiting Malik Riaz Hussain.

#### **Judgment**
1. **Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi**: Convicted under Sections 9(a)(ii), (iv), (vi), and (xii) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999. Sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 1 million, with an additional six months of imprisonment for non-payment.
2. **Bushra Imran**: Convicted for aiding and abetting under Section 9(a)(xii) of the NAO, 1999. Sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 500,000, with an additional three months of imprisonment for non-payment.
3. **Forfeiture**: The assets of the Al-Qadir University Project Trust were ordered to be forfeited to the Federal Government under Section 10(a) of the NAO, 1999.

#### **Legal Implications**
Both convicts face disqualification from holding public office under Section 15 of the NAO, 1999. The judgment underscores the court's stance against corruption and misuse of authority, particularly in cases involving public funds and white-collar crimes.
