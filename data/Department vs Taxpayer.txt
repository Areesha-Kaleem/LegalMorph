The credit transactions amounting to Rs.27,248,495/- appeared in the said account are in consequences of a) The cheque no. 0344666 dated 2-7-2003 received from Mr. Atiq Ahmed Qureshi/Sheikh Imran as 'Advances against sales" 2,300,000 B) The deposits of Rs.24,948,495/- arised on various dates out of declared sales at Rs.13,755,710/- of the tax year 2004 and the amount withdrawn Rs.2,000,000/- vide three cheques nos. 4618710. 4618711 & 4618714 from bank account no. 6036-271232-090 of Standard Chartered Bank Ltd Islamabad plus Bank AlFalah (loan Account) made during the year under appeal. 24,948,495 Total Deposits 41,840,495 ACCOUNT NO. 6036-120579-001: The credit amount of Rs.1,500,000/- as per said bank account created through receiving of two cheques No. 1346052 & 5616346 amounting to Rs. 1,400,000/- and Rs. 100,000/- respectively as part payment against sales from Major Gen. Ali Baaz that is declared in the tax year 2004. The learned first appellate authority has deleted the addition by appreciating and analyzing the evidence on facts and also on the legal grounds that assessment u/s 122(5) was without definite information. Hence he vacated the order passed by the Officer Inland Revenue. 6. We have heard the arguments and perused the relevant record available on file. Action of OIR to make total of credit transactions as suppressed receipt on presumptive basis without any corroborative evidence has rightly been deleted by learned first Appellate Authority. Total circulating/revolving capital of the taxpayer is Rs.320,269,964/-. He is a builder. If he withdraws some money from any of his account for any of expense. If after spending a fraction or some of the amount, rest is again deposited into bank, whether it will be treated as suppressed receipt, certainly not. It is not the case in which there is any of transaction exceeding limit of the total capital declared by the Taxpayer. In case of suppressed receipt, heavy burden lie upon the tax officer to point out specific facts of transaction i.e from whom and in what connection it was received, whether it was a sale proceed. It is not the case of revenue that Bank Accounts are not appearing in the statement of Taxpayer and were also not shown in the wealth statement of the directors Balance Sheets and Bank statements, both are available on record. Revenue failed to prove any nexus whatever between the amount lying in Bank through credit entry and sale receipts of taxpayer. Learned AR stressed upon the fact that requisite ingredients of definite information were altogether missing. In support of this contention he relied upon various judgments of court as well as High Courts which are as under: (1997) 76 TAX 131 (S.C. Pak)= 1997 PTD 1485 (S.C. Pak) (2004) 89 TAX 329 1986 PTD 37 (1989) 59 Tax 112 (H.C. Lah) (1997) PTD (Trib) 2037 (1941) 9 ITR. In this case department issued various notices under section 122, one after the other, all of these were well responded. Department kept on going for inquiries. In this scenario, the proceeding u/s 122(5) was void as held in ITA No. 1210/LB/06 dated 26-7-2008 and 2008 PTD (Trib) 491. In both of the cases it is held that fishing inquiries are not allowed while exercising the jurisdiction u/s 122(5) of income Tax Ordinance, 2001 Taxpayer is not to be put under fear that he has to remember scenario of each and every entry at the end of year. Rather he has to work freely and concentrate upon his projects to earn money. If he will earn something, he will pay to government exchequer. Such like attitude of Tax department to show the muscle neither serve the public exchequer nor the economy of the country. 7. Learned AR. Has contended that a perusal of the impugned order shows that in this case the OIR has not amended the deemed assessment on the basis of any definite information as required by the law. Rather he has made an open ended assessment by issuing three notices one after other for making fishing inquiries which is not permissible under the scheme of Ordinance, 2001. In first notice dated 8-5-2008 OIR confronted an amount of Rs.303,839,380/- for addition with the remark that most of payments have been made through Banking instruments including cheques/clearing pay order etc and asked the Taxpayer to explain nature and source of each and every credit transaction. 2nd show cause notice was issued on 11-5-2010 for compliance by 18-5- 2010, third notice No. 249 dated 11-5-2010 was issued and in all the notices inquiries were being made without confronting definite information that you sold, a shop/office to "X" against this consideration and credit entry exist in your record. Officer has taken easy approach just by making total of entries and added the amount without proving exact nexus of sale transaction. Main difference between information and definite one is that in case of definite information officer has not to probe. He does not need fishing inquiries that too from the Taxpayer. Learned CIR(A) has rightly satisfied himself by analysing same record which was produced by OIR. Addition of such amount without concrete evidence of proving nexus with business receipts neither play any positive role in economy nor add into government exchequer. Result is flight of capital from the country. The officer has not tried to mature the information into definite one by relating it with the person from whom receipts came and whether if was connected with business. Merely by saying that this is an arrangement of cash transaction to avoid addition of credit entries into account No. 6036-271232-090 which are deliberately tried to. Cover up from account No. 6036-0330.99.1 which is not acceptable. Such types of remarks based on conjecture and surmises neither fall under the head of definite information nor can become basis for invoking section 122(5). We fail to understand that an amount of Rs. 1,600,000/- was confronted for addition u/s 13(i)(a) for tax year 2004. How section I3(i)(a) of repealed ordinance has been invoked that too in tax year 2004. Some of cheques returned unpaid. In some of entries bank has charged mark up. Taxpayer has bank borrowing of Rs. 190,964,354/- in this year. His explained sources are as under:- 1. Sales declared. 13,755,710 2. Advances rent from pakistan Telenor effective from Oct. 2004 vide cheque no. 020660 dated 16-6-2004 credited in account no. 6036-033099-001 as declared in tax year 2005 14,592,000 3. Opening balance as on 1st July, 2003 18,957,900 4. Investment from Jawad Saeed Bajwa against sales of shares of plot 35,000,000 5 Bank borrowing account No. 6036-033099- 001 170,964,354 6. Adavnces against sales 47,000,000 7. Bank loan Alfalah bank 20,000,000 Total Transactions 320,269,964 Strange enough that out of total bank borrowing Rs.90,964,354/- an amount of Rs. 180,843,969/- has been taxed as deemed income just by totalling bank entries in 2008. i.e. After four years without proving the nexus of business receipts from where it came whether there were business receipts. A business man has to meet his exigencies of business, sometimes from the money kept in saving, sometimes asking someone in trade to meet his immediate requirement. This stance that each and every entry is business income without proving the exact nexus that "A", "B", "C" purchased which of structure built by taxpayer. The assessing authority is groping/probing in the dark and fishing through issuing notices again and again and therefore make open ended assessment by making fishing inquiries. The learned counsel has therefore, contended that as the taxation officer has not amended the deemed - assessment in accordance with law, the learned CIR(A) has therefore, rightly vacated the order. 8. This legal flaw in the assessment is in addition to the facts mentioned in the order of CIR(A) which is clear and unequivocal. The assessee has explained all the deposits and the so-called discrepancies in its accounts to the satisfaction of the CIR(A) against which no mentionable arguments has been advanced before us. In addition thereof the assessment is not in strict compliance of the provision and the procedure provided in law which has already been explained by us in a number of our judgments as well as the superior courts. With these observation order passed by learned first Appellate Authority is not open to any exception. So, the deletion, therefore, is unexceptional and the departmental appeal is considered of no merit. 9. Same is upheld and maintained. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.
