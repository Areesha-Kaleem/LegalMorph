Brief facts of the case are that after migration, the petitioners occupied the state land measuring 100 kanals comprising Killa No. 41/11,12,13,14,17,18,19,20, to 25 of Block No. 422/15, in Chak No. 3/BC, Tehsil and District Bahawalpur and were allotted the same under Abadkari Scheme. They also obtained proprietary rights but this fact was not reflected in the revenue record. Besides, the above said land the petitioners also occupied another It measuring 100 kanals in the same Chak comprising Killa Nos.42/12,13,14,15,16,17,22, and 23 of Block No. 442/11 and Killa Nos. 54/3,4,5,6-min of Block No. 442/12 without any lawfull authority. They have now requested for the regularization of their possession in Block No.442/H and 442/12 comprising 100 kanals which they have unlawfully occupied. 3. I have fixed the case for hearing on the judicial side and have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners. 4. In this case the petitioners have admittedly been allowed proprietary rights of lawfully occupied land i.e. 100 kanals in Block No. 422/15 under the Abadkari Scheme. Their request for regularization of unlawful possession of another 100 kanals in Block No. 442/11 and 442/12 is therefore not tenable. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners has however, pleaded leniency and requested for allowing the petitioners to purchase the said land in Block No. 442/11 and 442/12 at market price. Keeping in view long affiliation of the petitioners with the land in dispute since migration, I hereby allow them to purchase the said land on payment of current market price with 50% penalty for unauthorized possession and 10% surcharge, payable in 6 equal half yearly instalments. 6. With the above observations/directions the revision petition is disposed of. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.
