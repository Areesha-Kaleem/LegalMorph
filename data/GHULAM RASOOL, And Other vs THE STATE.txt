The facts in all the three cases are that the land indisputed was leased out to the petitioners under the 15 years Leases Scheme. The petitioners failed to pay the rent and the land was not brought to the extent of 90% under cultivation. The AC/Collector Lodhran resumed the land in dispute on 25.3.1981 accordingly. The petitioners along with others leases filed Writ Petition in the Lahore High Court and after decision of High Court the petitioners filed appeal before the Addl. Commissioner, who dismissed the same on the point of limitation, vide order dated 26.11.1992. Petitioners filed revision petitions ROR No. 1395/94, 1369/94 and 1370/94 which were also dismissed on 15.5.1995 and 30.3.1995. Hence these review petitions. 3. The learned counsel for the petition has contended that both the lower Courts have passed orders without consulting the record, the land was resumed without issuing notices to the petitioners and non-cultivation or nonpayment of rent are rectifiable breaches. 4. In these cases both the breaches i.e. Non-cultivation of the disputed land to the required extent and non-payment of arrears of lagan are rectifiable. I therefore condone the lapse with a penalty of Rs.5,000/- each and restore the lease in favour of the petitioners extending the same up to Rabi 1998. The petitioners should deposit all the arrears of lagan with the penalty of Rs.5,000/- each within three months enabling themselves to apply for the grant of proprietary rights under the new scheme of 1995. With the above observations all the three review petitions are accepted and the orders of lower Courts and the orders under review are modified accordingly. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.
