Copy of this Judgment be sent to respondents for information and compliance. File after completion be consigned to record." After that, in pursuance of Judgment dated 17.09.2014, RPO, Naseerabad Region, Balochistan reinstated the appellant in service vide order dated 24.11.2014, and de novo inquiry was initiated against the appellant -while, SSP, Jaffaraba was appointed as Enquiry Officer and on the recommendations of Enquiry Officer, punishment of forfeiture of 06 months' approved service was imposed on the appellant vide order dated 07.07.2015, thereafter the aforesaid case was reopened after lapse of 02 years and 03 months, and final show-cause notice dated 04.01.2017, was served on the appellant by the respondent No. 2, the appellant submitted his reply to the aforesaid final show-cause notice and contended that after his reinstatement in service and after conclusion of de novo inquiry penalty of forfeiture of 06 months' approved service has been inflicted on the appellant and initiation of another disciplinary proceedings on the basis of same allegation has not been warranted under the law, and is against the Article-13 of the Constitution, after that the respondent No. 2 accepted the defence plea taken by the appellant and closed the inquiry vide order dated 07.02.2017, thereafter the respondent No. 2 on the very next date of passing the aforesaid order of closing the inquiry, served another charge-sheet dated 08.02.2017, and some frivolous and vague charges were leveled against the appellant pertaining to the same period of his posting as SHO City, Sibi from 28.06.2013 to 02.09.2013, after that, final show-cause notice dated 24.02.2017, was served on the appellant and the appellant submitted his reply and once again denied the charges, but the respondent No. 2 without affording the appellant with any opportunity of personal hearing, passed another final order dated 22.03.2017, and imposed major punishment of dismissal from service on the appellant. Feeling aggrieved from the impugned order dated 22.03.2017, the appellant preferred departmental appeal on 31.03.2017,' for his re-reinstatement in service before the respondent No. 1, which remained un-responded. Hence, the instant appeal. 3. The respondents contested the appeal on legal and factual grounds by filing their Para-wise comments. 4. We have heard the learned counsel for appellant as well as the learned Additional Advocate General, Balochistan oh behalf of respondents and perused the record with their assistance. 5. The learned counsel for appellant contended that the appellant could not have been punished twice on the same allegations, which is against the law/rules. It is further contended that after dismissal from service de novo inquiry was conducted against the appellant and on the recommendations of Enquiry Officer, punishment of forfeiture of 06 months' approved service was imposed on the appellant, and he could not be awarded the penalty of dismissal from service on same charges by using different phraseology in quite vague terms. 6. On the other hand, the learned Additional Advocate General vehemently opposed the' contention raised by the counsel for appellant and defended the impugned order. 7. From perusal of the record it appears that on 07.07.2015, after conclusion of de novo inquiry under the Balochistan Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2011 penalty of forfeiture of 6 months' approved service was imposed on the appellant, thereafter on 08.02.2017, the respondent No. 2 served another charge-sheet under Rule 6(1)(a) of the Balochistan Police Disciplinary Rules, 1975 upon the appellant and after that, final show-cause notice dated 24.02.2017, was served on the appellant and the appellant submitted his reply but the respondent No. 2 imposed major punishment of dismissal from service on the appellant under the Balochistan Police Disciplinary Rules, 1975 vide order 'dated 22.03.2017. 8. Perusal of the record further indicates that entire disciplinary proceedings conducted against the appellant were derogatory of the principles of natural justice , and the impugned order is not based on an iota of evidence and suffers from numerous legal infirmities and before infliction of major penalty of dismissal from service no disciplinary proceedings were conducted in accordance with the Balochistan Police Disciplinary Rules, 1975, whereas dismissal from service is a major penalty and could not be inflicted without holding formal full-fledge inquiry by recording evidence in the presence of appellant who was also entitled to cross-examine any witness produced against him as well as to produce defence evidence in support of his innocence, and the inquiry by way of a questionnaire without recording evidence in support of allegations or defence is not warranted under the law and the manner in which inquiry proceedings were initiated by way of questionnaire has time and again been disapproved by the Hon'ble Superior Courts. 9. Admittedly, in the case in hand without holding a full-fledged inquiry as per Balochistan Police Disciplinary Rules, 1975 against the appellant the Competent Authority opted to take action through " summary trial " by issuing only Show-Cause Notice. It is true that the Competent Authority has vested discretionary powers to hold or discard regular inquiry, but it is equally true that such discretion is not given to the authority to be exercised arbitrarily but honestly, justly and fairly in the spirit of Rules. 10. It is by now well-settled principle of law that in case of awarding major penalty, a proper inquiry is required to be conducted in accordance with law wherein a full opportunity of defence is to be provided to the accused civil servant. The Balochistan Police Disciplinary Rules, 1975 clearly stipulates that in case of charge of . misconduct, a full-fledged inquiry is required to be conducted. In this regard reliance is placed on 2003 SCMR 207 , 2004 SCMR 316 and PLD 2008 SC 392 . 11. Furthermore, the impugned order is also violative of Article 10(A) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, because as mentioned in Para supra , major penalty of dismissal from service was imposed upon the appellant without holding any proper inquiry and recording evidence in support of allegations or in rebuttal thereof. Such course is manifestly denial of right of fair trial to the appellant which is complete negation of aforesaid Fundamental Right guaranteed by the Constitution. 12. The upshot of the above discussion is that major penalty of dismissal from service imposed upon the appellant vide impugned order dated 22.03.2017, without adhering the provisions of the applicable Rules. Thus, we are fully convinced that the appellant was totally condemned unheard which is against the natural justice. 13. In view of the above discussion, the matter is remanded to the respondents for holding de novo inquiry against the appellant in accordance with the Baluchistan Police Efficiency & Disciplinary Rules, 1975' and to decide the matter preferably within a period of four months from the date of receipt of copy of this Judgment. Thus, the impugned ,order No. 3098-40021/16(1)/E, dated 22.03.2017, is set aside and the respondents are directed to hold de novo inquiry against the appellant .
