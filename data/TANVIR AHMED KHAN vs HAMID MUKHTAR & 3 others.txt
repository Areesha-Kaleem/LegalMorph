The petitioner owned 76-Kanals, 14-Marlas of land whereas the respondent was owner of 8-Kanals. The petitioner's education was F.Sc. whereas the respondent was primary pass. The petitioner was quite young energetic and was able to perform duties of Lambardar efficiently. The hereditary claim could not be made basis for appointment of Lambardar. The District Collector, Toba Tek Singh appointed the petitioner as Lambardar. The appointment of Lambardar was purely and administrative matter and the District Collector appointed the most suitable person. The petitioner was entitled to be appointed as Lambardar and he had preferential edge over the Respondent No, 1 on all counts. Finally, it was prayed that the review petition may be accepted. 5.

The orders passed by the apex Court were binding upon all the subordinate Courts of the country. Finally, it was prayed that the review petition may be dismissed. 6. We have given due considerations to the arguments presented by learned Counsels by both parties and have also gone through the record available in the file. The view of the learned Counsel for Respondent No, 1 is not applicable in instant case. In PLD 1965 Supreme Court 393 the Civil Appeal No, 1 of 1965 was decided on 11.02.1965.
