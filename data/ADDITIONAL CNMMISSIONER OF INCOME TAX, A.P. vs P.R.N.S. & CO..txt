Divan Raghuvir Citations Advocates Statutes 37 TAX 45 Judgment JUDGMENT [The judgment of the court was delivered by B. J. Divan C.J.]- In this case at the instance of the revenue the following question has been referred to us for our opinion: "Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the interest charged under section 139 for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 is liable to be cancelled under section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961?" The facts giving rise to this reference are as follows: We are concerned withe assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65. The assessee is a registered partnership firm carrying on business of transport. For the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 it had to file its returns of income under section 139(2) on or before November 15, 1962, September 30, 1963, and September 30, 1964. Respectively as its previous year ended withe the financial year in the there years of assessment. Notices under section 139(2) were also served on 24th August. 1962, 27th August, 1963, and 18th July, 1964, for the there assessment years, respectively. However, the return of income was filed on March 23, 1963, in respect of the assessment year 1962-63. The Income Tax Officer completed the assessments for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 (sic) for non-compliance of notices under sections 134(2) and 142(1) for all the there years and also for non-compliance of notices under section 139(2) for 1963-64 and 1964.65. It appears that the Income Tax Officer proceeded under section 144 in assessments made for the years 1963-64 and 1964-65. Returns of income for assessment years 1963-64 and 1964- 65 were filed on August I6, 1965, after the assessment under section 144 had been completed. On an appeal filed by the assessee the Appellate tribunal directed the Income Ta* Office! To reframe the assessments in accordance withe law cancelling the best judgment assessment. After the decision of the Tribunal, when the assessments were being made afresh for the there years under reference the Income-tax Officer charged interest (what is popularly known as penal interest) under section 139 for the delay in filing the returns and also levied penalities under section 271(1 )(a) The interest charged under section 139 for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 came to Rs. 1,554, Rs. 5,051 ann Rs. 1,333, respectively. The assessee thereafter applied for rectification under the provisions of section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and requested that the interest charged under section 139(1) may be deleted as the assessee had not filed applications seeking extension of time for filing the returns. The applications for rectification were rejected by the Income Tax Officer on the ground that there was no mistake apparent from the record. The assessee preferred appeals against the ing to entertain the petitions under section 154 and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner affirmed the view taken by the Income Tax Officer. The matter was taken in further appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the assessee contended that the Andhra Pradesh High Court had held in Kishanlal Haricharan v. Income Tax Officer {197 i] 82 ITR 660 (AP) that interest cannot be charged unless the assessee had filed an Application forex- tension of time in Form No. 6 and it was contended by the present assessee before the Tribunal that there was a mistake committed by the Income Tax Officer in charging interest and this mistake was apparent from the record. The Tribunal accepted the contention of the assessee by holding that once a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was rendered it was binding on all courts, quasi-judicial authorities and other authorities in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the Tribunal observed that the Income Tax Officer committed a mistake apparent from the record in charging the interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the applications filed by the assessee under section 154 should be allowed. Therefore, at the instance of the revenue the question hereinabove set out has been referred to us for our opinion. The scope of section 154 of the Income-tax Act has been explained by the Supreme Court in T.S. Balaram. Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers [1971) 82 ITR 50 (SC). Section 154 provides for rectification of any mistake apparent from the record Hegde J., delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court in T. S. Balaram, Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 i.e 50 (SC), has pointed out that a mistake apparent on the record must be an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there may be conceivably two opinions, A decision on a debatable point of law is not a mistake apparent from the record. At page 53 of the report Hegde J, speaking for the court, observed: "It is clear that the question whether section 17 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act-, 1922, was applicable to the case of the first respondent is not free from doubt. Therefore, the Income-tax Officer was not justified in thanking that on that question there can be no two opinions. It Was not open to the Income-tax Officer to go into the true scope of the relevant provision of the Act in a proceeding under section 154 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. A mistake apparent on the record must be an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there may conceivably be two opinions. As seen earlier, the High Court of Bombay opined that the original assessments were in accordance withe law though in our opinion the High Court was not justified in going into that question." The Supreme Court in T. S. B alar am v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 ITR 50 (SC) left the question open whether the distinction between the expression ''error apparent on the face of the record" occurring in the context of the powers of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution and the expression "mistake apparent from the record" occurring in section 154 of the Income-tax Act was necessary to be spelled out. However, the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in cases arising under article 226 were applied in the case arising under section 154 of the Income-tax Act in T.S. Baloram v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 ITR 50 (SC). Mr. Rama Rao, the learned standing counsel for the income-tax department, has urged before us that in the instant case the question whether interest under section 139 is chargeable in respect of an assessee who has not applied for extension of time is a debateable question. He drew our attention to the decision in Kishanlal Haricharan v. Income-tax Officer [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) and pointed out that Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) sitting singly in the High Court has sought to distinguish the decision in Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income-tax Officer [1976] 105 ITR 226 (AP) and the decision in Haricharan's case [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) in connection withe a different set of facts. A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court consisting of Chinnappa Reddy and Madhava Reddy JJ. Held in Kishanlal Haricharan's case [1971] 82 i.e 660 (AP) that it is only when an assessee requests for time under the third clause of the proviso to section 139 (l) (b) that he can be directed to pay penal interest as provided in the clause and where the assessee does not request for time for submitting a return the third clause has no application. Further consequences may follow. For example, the petitioner may subject himself to the penality provided under section 271 of the Act. The petitioner may also subject himself to a best judgment assessment by the Income-tax Officer. Those consequences may follow when the assessee fails to submit a return, but the consequence of paying penal interest does not follow. The assessee is liable to pay penal interest under the third clause of the proviso to section 139 (l> (b) only if he asks for extension of time under that clause. This decision in Kishnanlal Haricharan v. Income-tax Officer [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) was followed by another Division Bench consisting of Chinnappa Reddy and A. D, V. Reddy JJ. In R. C. No.81 of 1970 [Commissioner of Income-tax v. M. Manik Rao [1977] 109 ITR 580 (AP) (Appendix)] decided on 17th December, 1971. The same principle was reiterated by Chinnappa Reddy J., delivering the judgment of the Division Bench, as follows (see infra p. 58)]: -'Since interest was not chargeable unless time bad been extended, the Tribunal was justified in holding that time must have been extended on the application of the assessee." In the earlier portion of the judgment he has also reiterated (see infra p. 581); "Since interest is chargeable under the third clause of the proviso only when the Income-tax Officer extends the time for the furnishing of the return on the application of the assessee, the Appellate Tribunal presumed that there must have been an application by the assessee and that the Income-tax Officer must have extended the time for filing the return. The Tribunal thought that it was justified in drawing such a presumption as the correct state of facts was not clear from the records of the case which were available to them. We cannot say that the Tribunal erred in drawing such an inference." Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) sitting singly decided the case of Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income-tax Officer [1976] 105 ITR 226, 229 (AP) and he distinguished the case of Kishanal Haricharan [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) in the following manner: "Clause (i.e> of the proviso has to be read withe sub-section (4) of section 139 of the Act. If clause (i.e) of the proviso is read withe sub-section (4) of section 139 then the position becomes clear that any person, who has not furnished returns within the time allowed to him under sub-section (1) will come within the mischief of clause (i.e) of the proviso to section 139(1), Therefore, the fact that no application was made by the petitioner for extension of time is not relevant at all in view of sub-section (4) of section 139 of the Act." Where returns have been filed beyond the dates mentioned in clause (i) and (ii), section 139(2) would automatically be attracted. The mere fact that the assessee Sled returns pursuant to the notice issued to him under section 148 does not make any difference, for what has to be seen is whether he has filed the returns beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) and not whether he has applied for extension of time under clauses (i) and (ii) and failed to furnish the returns within the time allowed either under clause (i) or clause (ii) of the proviso. In paragraph 6 of his judgment Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) observed (page 228): "The case on hand is one where returns have been filed beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso to section 139 (l) and, therefore, sub-section (4) of section 139 is automatically attracted. The mere fact that the petitioner filed the returns pursuant to the notice issued to him under section 148 threatening to assess him under section 147 does not make any difference, for what has to be seen is whether he has filed the returns beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) and not whether he applied for extension of time under clauses (i) and (ii) and failed to furnish the returns within the time allowed either under clause (i) or clause (ii) of the proviso. The Division Bench in the case cited above was not dealing withe a case which falls under sub-section (4) of section 139. That was a case where no returns were at all filed even though the Income-tax Officer issued a notice to the petitioner therein under section 139(2) calling upon him to submit a return before a particular date. Therefore, the case where no returns were field stands on a different footing from a case where returns wes filed, pursuant to a notice issued by the Income-tax Officer under section 148," It is true, as Sri M. J. Swamy appearing for the assessee pointed out, that in the instant case the rectification application was made by the assessee before July, 1971, which was the last date for filing the application under section 154. It is also true, as he emphasised, that the decision of Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) in Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income- tax Officer [1976J 105 ITR 226 (AP) was delivered on July 11, 1976, and, therefore, at the time when the rectification application first came up before the Income-tax Officer some time before July, 1971, there was no question of the department relying upon the decision of Obul Reddi J. (as he then was). However, it must be pointed out that the ground on which Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) distinguished the decision of the Division Bench in Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP) could have been urged as a ground for distinguishing the decision in the Division Bench's ruling in Kishanlal Hericharan's case {1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP). On the facts of this case, when the assessment orders came to be passed on merits under section 143(1) of the Income-tax Act, returns were, in fact, filed. But they were filed after the due dates. Therefore, the question of fact whether this was a proper filing in the eye of the law, secondly, whether the returns so filed, in fact, distinguished the case from Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP), whether no returns at all were filed and whether the provisions of section 139(4) could be read in the light of the facts of this particular case, certainly raise a debatable question of law in the instant case. In these circumstances, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in T. S. Balaram. Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers (1971) 82 ITR 50 (SC), it is clear that the provisions of section 154 were certainly not applicable. Here, the mistake could only be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there could conceivably be two opinions, namely, whether the case fell within the principle laid down in Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP) or whether it could be distinguished on the line of reasoning adopted by Obul Reddi J, (as he then was) in Progressive Engineering Co.s case (1976) 105 ITR 226 (AP). Hence, it is obvious that i.e was not open to the Income-tax Officer or any other authority functioning under section 154 of the Income-tax Ac to rectify the earlier orders charging interest in respect of each of the there assessment years. In view of this conclusion, we must answer the question referred to us in the negative, that is, in favour of the revenue and against the assessee. The assessee will pay the costs of this reference to the Commissioner of income-tax. APPENDIX (In the Andhra Pradesh High Court) COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX A. P. Versus M. MALIK RAO Chimappa Reddy & A. D. V. Reddy JJ. December 17,1971. Case Referred No. 81 of 1970. JUDGMENT Chinnappa Reddy J.-The assessee submitted his returns of income beyond the period prescribed by section 129(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The Income-tax Officer accepted the returns and proceeded withe the assessment. He charged interest under the third clause of the proviso to section 139(1) of the Act. He also levied penality under section 271(i)(a) of the Act on the ground that the assessee had failed without reasonable cause to furnish the returns of income, which he was required to furnish under section 139(1). Under the third clause of the proviso to section 139(1), the Income-tax Officer is empowered, in his discretion, on an application by the assessee to extend the date for furnishing a return of income up to any period, in which case interest at 6% shall be payable by the assessee from the first day of October or the lst day of January, as the case may be, of the assessment year to the date of the furnishing of the return. Since interest is chargeable under the third clause of the proviso only when the Income-tax Officer extends the time for the furnishing of the return on the application of the assessee, the Appellate Tribunal presumed that there must have been an application by the assesses and that the Income-tax Officer must have extended the time for filing the return. The Tribunal thought that it was justified in drawing such a presumption as the correct state of facts was not clear from the records of the case which were available to them. We cannot say that the Tribunal erred in drawing such an inference. Illustration (e) to section 114 of the Evidence Act authorises the drawing of a presumption that official acts have been regularly performed. Since interest was not chargeable unless time had been extended, the Tribunal was justified in holding that time must have been extended on the application of the assessee. Accepting that finding we agree withe the Tribunal that penality was not leviable. The questions referred to us are, therefore, answered in favour of the assessee and against the department. Then will be po order as to costs. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.

Divan, Raghuvir Title: ADDITIONAL CNMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, A.P. vs P.R.N.S. & CO. Case No.: Case referred No. 18 of 1975 Date of Judgment: 1976-08-20 Reported As: 37 TAX 45 Result: orders refus Judgment JUDGMENT [The judgment of the court was delivered by B. J. Divan C.J.]- In this case at the instance of the revenue the following question has been referred to us for our opinion: "Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the interest charged under section 139 for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 is liable to be cancelled under section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961?" The facts giving rise to this reference are as follows: We are concerned withe assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65. The assessee is a registered partnership firm carrying on business of transport. For the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 it had to file its returns of income under section 139(2) on or before November 15, 1962, September 30, 1963, and September 30, 1964. Respectively as its previous year ended withe the financial year in the there years of assessment. Notices under section 139(2) were also served on 24th August. 1962, 27th August, 1963, and 18th July, 1964, for the there assessment years, respectively. However, the return of income was filed on March 23, 1963, in respect of the assessment year 1962-63. The Income Tax Officer completed the assessments for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 (sic) for non-compliance of notices under sections 134(2) and 142(1) for all the there years and also for non-compliance of notices under section 139(2) for 1963-64 and 1964.65. It appears that the Income Tax Officer proceeded under section 144 in assessments made for the years 1963-64 and 1964-65. Returns of income for assessment years 1963-64 and 1964- 65 were filed on August I6, 1965, after the assessment under section 144 had been completed. On an appeal filed by the assessee the Appellate tribunal directed the Income Ta* Office! To reframe the assessments in accordance withe law cancelling the best judgment assessment. After the decision of the Tribunal, when the assessments were being made afresh for the there years under reference the Income-tax Officer charged interest (what is popularly known as penal interest) under section 139 for the delay in filing the returns and also levied penalities under section 271(1 )(a) The interest charged under section 139 for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65 came to Rs. 1,554, Rs. 5,051 ann Rs. 1,333, respectively. The assessee thereafter applied for rectification under the provisions of section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and requested that the interest charged under section 139(1) may be deleted as the assessee had not filed applications seeking extension of time for filing the returns. The applications for rectification were rejected by the Income Tax Officer on the ground that there was no mistake apparent from the record. The assessee preferred appeals against the ing to entertain the petitions under section 154 and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner affirmed the view taken by the Income Tax Officer. The matter was taken in further appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the assessee contended that the Andhra Pradesh High Court had held in Kishanlal Haricharan v. Income Tax Officer {197 i] 82 ITR 660 (AP) that interest cannot be charged unless the assessee had filed an Application forex- tension of time in Form No. 6 and it was contended by the present assessee before the Tribunal that there was a mistake committed by the Income Tax Officer in charging interest and this mistake was apparent from the record. The Tribunal accepted the contention of the assessee by holding that once a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was rendered it was binding on all courts, quasi-judicial authorities and other authorities in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the Tribunal observed that the Income Tax Officer committed a mistake apparent from the record in charging the interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal held that the applications filed by the assessee under section 154 should be allowed. Therefore, at the instance of the revenue the question hereinabove set out has been referred to us for our opinion. The scope of section 154 of the Income-tax Act has been explained by the Supreme Court in T.S. Balaram. Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers [1971) 82 ITR 50 (SC). Section 154 provides for rectification of any mistake apparent from the record Hegde J., delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court in T. S. Balaram, Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 i.e 50 (SC), has pointed out that a mistake apparent on the record must be an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there may be conceivably two opinions, A decision on a debatable point of law is not a mistake apparent from the record. At page 53 of the report Hegde J, speaking for the court, observed: "It is clear that the question whether section 17 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act-, 1922, was applicable to the case of the first respondent is not free from doubt. Therefore, the Income-tax Officer was not justified in thanking that on that question there can be no two opinions. It Was not open to the Income-tax Officer to go into the true scope of the relevant provision of the Act in a proceeding under section 154 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. A mistake apparent on the record must be an obvious and patent mistake and not something which can be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there may conceivably be two opinions. As seen earlier, the High Court of Bombay opined that the original assessments were in accordance withe law though in our opinion the High Court was not justified in going into that question." The Supreme Court in T. S. B alar am v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 ITR 50 (SC) left the question open whether the distinction between the expression ''error apparent on the face of the record" occurring in the context of the powers of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution and the expression "mistake apparent from the record" occurring in section 154 of the Income-tax Act was necessary to be spelled out. However, the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in cases arising under article 226 were applied in the case arising under section 154 of the Income-tax Act in T.S. Baloram v. Volkart Brothers [1971] 82 ITR 50 (SC). Mr. Rama Rao, the learned standing counsel for the income-tax department, has urged before us that in the instant case the question whether interest under section 139 is chargeable in respect of an assessee who has not applied for extension of time is a debateable question. He drew our attention to the decision in Kishanlal Haricharan v. Income-tax Officer [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) and pointed out that Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) sitting singly in the High Court has sought to distinguish the decision in Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income-tax Officer [1976] 105 ITR 226 (AP) and the decision in Haricharan's case [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) in connection withe a different set of facts. A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court consisting of Chinnappa Reddy and Madhava Reddy JJ. Held in Kishanlal Haricharan's case [1971] 82 i.e 660 (AP) that it is only when an assessee requests for time under the third clause of the proviso to section 139 (l) (b) that he can be directed to pay penal interest as provided in the clause and where the assessee does not request for time for submitting a return the third clause has no application. Further consequences may follow. For example, the petitioner may subject himself to the penality provided under section 271 of the Act. The petitioner may also subject himself to a best judgment assessment by the Income-tax Officer. Those consequences may follow when the assessee fails to submit a return, but the consequence of paying penal interest does not follow. The assessee is liable to pay penal interest under the third clause of the proviso to section 139 (l> (b) only if he asks for extension of time under that clause. This decision in Kishnanlal Haricharan v. Income-tax Officer [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) was followed by another Division Bench consisting of Chinnappa Reddy and A. D, V. Reddy JJ. In R. C. No.81 of 1970 [Commissioner of Income-tax v. M. Manik Rao [1977] 109 ITR 580 (AP) (Appendix)] decided on 17th December, 1971. The same principle was reiterated by Chinnappa Reddy J., delivering the judgment of the Division Bench, as follows (see infra p. 58)]: -'Since interest was not chargeable unless time bad been extended, the Tribunal was justified in holding that time must have been extended on the application of the assessee." In the earlier portion of the judgment he has also reiterated (see infra p. 581); "Since interest is chargeable under the third clause of the proviso only when the Income-tax Officer extends the time for the furnishing of the return on the application of the assessee, the Appellate Tribunal presumed that there must have been an application by the assessee and that the Income-tax Officer must have extended the time for filing the return. The Tribunal thought that it was justified in drawing such a presumption as the correct state of facts was not clear from the records of the case which were available to them. We cannot say that the Tribunal erred in drawing such an inference." Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) sitting singly decided the case of Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income-tax Officer [1976] 105 ITR 226, 229 (AP) and he distinguished the case of Kishanal Haricharan [1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP) in the following manner: "Clause (i.e> of the proviso has to be read withe sub-section (4) of section 139 of the Act. If clause (i.e) of the proviso is read withe sub-section (4) of section 139 then the position becomes clear that any person, who has not furnished returns within the time allowed to him under sub-section (1) will come within the mischief of clause (i.e) of the proviso to section 139(1), Therefore, the fact that no application was made by the petitioner for extension of time is not relevant at all in view of sub-section (4) of section 139 of the Act." Where returns have been filed beyond the dates mentioned in clause (i) and (ii), section 139(2) would automatically be attracted. The mere fact that the assessee Sled returns pursuant to the notice issued to him under section 148 does not make any difference, for what has to be seen is whether he has filed the returns beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) and not whether he has applied for extension of time under clauses (i) and (ii) and failed to furnish the returns within the time allowed either under clause (i) or clause (ii) of the proviso. In paragraph 6 of his judgment Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) observed (page 228): "The case on hand is one where returns have been filed beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso to section 139 (l) and, therefore, sub-section (4) of section 139 is automatically attracted. The mere fact that the petitioner filed the returns pursuant to the notice issued to him under section 148 threatening to assess him under section 147 does not make any difference, for what has to be seen is whether he has filed the returns beyond the dates mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) and not whether he applied for extension of time under clauses (i) and (ii) and failed to furnish the returns within the time allowed either under clause (i) or clause (ii) of the proviso. The Division Bench in the case cited above was not dealing withe a case which falls under sub-section (4) of section 139. That was a case where no returns were at all filed even though the Income-tax Officer issued a notice to the petitioner therein under section 139(2) calling upon him to submit a return before a particular date. Therefore, the case where no returns were field stands on a different footing from a case where returns wes filed, pursuant to a notice issued by the Income-tax Officer under section 148," It is true, as Sri M. J. Swamy appearing for the assessee pointed out, that in the instant case the rectification application was made by the assessee before July, 1971, which was the last date for filing the application under section 154. It is also true, as he emphasised, that the decision of Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) in Progressive Engineering Co. v. Income- tax Officer [1976J 105 ITR 226 (AP) was delivered on July 11, 1976, and, therefore, at the time when the rectification application first came up before the Income-tax Officer some time before July, 1971, there was no question of the department relying upon the decision of Obul Reddi J. (as he then was). However, it must be pointed out that the ground on which Obul Reddi J. (as he then was) distinguished the decision of the Division Bench in Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP) could have been urged as a ground for distinguishing the decision in the Division Bench's ruling in Kishanlal Hericharan's case {1971] 82 ITR 660 (AP). On the facts of this case, when the assessment orders came to be passed on merits under section 143(1) of the Income-tax Act, returns were, in fact, filed. But they were filed after the due dates. Therefore, the question of fact whether this was a proper filing in the eye of the law, secondly, whether the returns so filed, in fact, distinguished the case from Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP), whether no returns at all were filed and whether the provisions of section 139(4) could be read in the light of the facts of this particular case, certainly raise a debatable question of law in the instant case. In these circumstances, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in T. S. Balaram. Income-tax Officer v. Volkart Brothers (1971) 82 ITR 50 (SC), it is clear that the provisions of section 154 were certainly not applicable. Here, the mistake could only be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points on which there could conceivably be two opinions, namely, whether the case fell within the principle laid down in Kishanlal Haricharan's case (1971) 82 ITR 660 (AP) or whether it could be distinguished on the line of reasoning adopted by Obul Reddi J, (as he then was) in Progressive Engineering Co.s case (1976) 105 ITR 226 (AP). Hence, it is obvious that i.e was not open to the Income-tax Officer or any other authority functioning under section 154 of the Income-tax Ac to rectify the earlier orders charging interest in respect of each of the there assessment years. In view of this conclusion, we must answer the question referred to us in the negative, that is, in favour of the revenue and against the assessee. The assessee will pay the costs of this reference to the Commissioner of income-tax. APPENDIX (In the Andhra Pradesh High Court) COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX A. P. Versus M. MALIK RAO Chimappa Reddy & A. D. V. Reddy JJ. December 17,1971. Case Referred No. 81 of 1970. JUDGMENT Chinnappa Reddy J.-The assessee submitted his returns of income beyond the period prescribed by section 129(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The Income-tax Officer accepted the returns and proceeded withe the assessment. He charged interest under the third clause of the proviso to section 139(1) of the Act. He also levied penality under section 271(i)(a) of the Act on the ground that the assessee had failed without reasonable cause to furnish the returns of income, which he was required to furnish under section 139(1). Under the third clause of the proviso to section 139(1), the Income-tax Officer is empowered, in his discretion, on an application by the assessee to extend the date for furnishing a return of income up to any period, in which case interest at 6% shall be payable by the assessee from the first day of October or the lst day of January, as the case may be, of the assessment year to the date of the furnishing of the return. Since interest is chargeable under the third clause of the proviso only when the Income-tax Officer extends the time for the furnishing of the return on the application of the assessee, the Appellate Tribunal presumed that there must have been an application by the assesses and that the Income-tax Officer must have extended the time for filing the return. The Tribunal thought that it was justified in drawing such a presumption as the correct state of facts was not clear from the records of the case which were available to them. We cannot say that the Tribunal erred in drawing such an inference. Illustration (e) to section 114 of the Evidence Act authorises the drawing of a presumption that official acts have been regularly performed. Since interest was not chargeable unless time had been extended, the Tribunal was justified in holding that time must have been extended on the application of the assessee. Accepting that finding we agree withe the Tribunal that penality was not leviable. The questions referred to us are, therefore, answered in favour of the assessee and against the department. Then will be po order as to costs.
