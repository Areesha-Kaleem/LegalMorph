She therefore submitted her declaration from LR-I indicating the land involved in these 13 mutations as having been alienated by her with the detail reproduced above. The sales were examined by the Land Commissioner, Sargodha who held them as void on the ground that these transactions were hit by the provisions of para. 25 of the repealed Land Reforms Regulation No, 64 of 1959 because out of 477 kanals 8 marlas of land the sale effected through mutation No, 1396 dated 15-5-1970 reduced her holding to less than an economic holding. Hence this appeal. 4. The case was referred by me for enquiry to the Legal Adviser who has submitted his report dated 12-1-1973 which I have seen. 5. Muhammad Siddique brother of Mohammad Sharif, attorney for the appellant has stated before me that some of the vendees had already been served for appearance before this Cour today but on account of death of some of their relation they have not turned up. I find that Muhammad Khan, Ahmad Khan and Allah Bakhsh vendees had appeared before the Legal Advisor to whom the case had been referred for inquiry and report. The learned counsel has contested before me that after the alienation recorded in mutation No, 1395 dated 15-5-70 the balance of the holding of the appellant was 400 kanals which was still an economic holding. The subsequent tranefer of 2 kanals and 10 marlas and 3 ',canals and 6 marlas for residential purposes vide Mutations Nos. 1396 and 1397 in favour of Zulfiqar and Sarfraz was not hit by provisions of paragraph 25 of M.L.R. 64 in view of their being required for building purposes vide sub-para. 6 of paragraph 25 of M.L.R. 64. The fact that the area was for residential purposes is borne out by the entry in the two mutations in question themselves where the expression is `Baya baraye sikni'. After transfer of these two plots for residential purposes, the appellant was left with 394 kanals and 4 marlas. All this area was subsequently disposed of on 16-5-1970 vide mutations Nos. 1395 to 1407 and after this disposal the apellant was not left with any area in the village. She had thus disposed of entire holding and therefore, was not affected by the paragraph 25 ibid. 6. The learned counsel does not wish to press the point taken up by him earlier brfore the Legal Adviser and mentioned in his appeal that the date of transfer should be taken as 17-5-1970 which is the date of attestation and not the date of the entry of the mutations which are 15-5-1970 and 16-5-1970. 7. The learned counsel further urges that these transfers were already put into effect. The possession of the vendees is reflected in the revenue record, viz. Register Haqdaran Zamin and Khasra Girdawari etc. From Kharif 1970 and in some cases from Rabi 1971 and in the case of Allah Bakhsh Vendee from Rabi 1972. It is explained in case of this vendee that this land was `Banjar and was brought under cultivation in Rabi 1972. The learned counsel further urged that all these alienations are already protected under Explanation III of para. 7(1)(b) of M.L.R. 115. 8. In view of the facts stated in paragraph 5 according to which on 16-5-70 the holding of the appellant had already been reduced to less than an economic holding by valid transactions and since on the same day she disposed off her balance holding the alienations are not hit by para. 25(3) of M.L.R. 64, as this sub-paragraph allows alienation of the entire holding. The provisions are silent whether this alienation should in favour of one individual or more than one individual. But it is obvious that in the situation where a provision does not specifically prohibit such a sale in favour of more than one individual, the prohibitory law cannot be enforced against the vendees. In these circumstances, the order of the Land Commissioner, dated 4-7-1972 whereby he declared as void mutations Nos. 1395 to 1407 of village Rajana Tehsil and District Jhang is set aside. The appeal is accepted accordingly.
