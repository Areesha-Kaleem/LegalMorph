The main grievance of the appellants is common, against Sardar Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Executive Engineer, to the effect that he was approved for the post of Assistant Engineer Electricity in 1981 and his appointment was confirmed as such on 20-1-1982 but the seniority, in his case has been determined with effect from 15-7-1974. According to the appellants, the appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, made on 15-7-1974, was of ad hoc nature and the same came to an end, when the said respondent was transferred back to his present department, namely, Planning and Development. According to the appellants, the seniority of Muhammad Ashraf as Assistant Engineer Electricity could be determined with effect from 20-1-1982, when according to them, his regular appointment was ordered. 2. Chaudhry Inayatullah also attacked the order, on the ground that seniority of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin and Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was illegally determined. According to him, his name preceded in the merit lists, the names of these two officers, therefore, seniority should have been determined according to the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission and not on the basis of the Ad hoc appointment, held by these officers. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas claims seniority against Mushtaq Ahmed Gorsi on the basis of merit assigned at the time of selection. The seniority of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan has been challenged in all the three appeals. Mr. Iqbal Ratyal has the grievance in matter of the seniority only against Muhammad Ashraf Khan. 3. The facts of the case as noticed by us are that Muhammad Ashraf Khan was holding a post of Planning Officer, in the Planning and Development Department, in Pay Scale 400-1000. His post was up-graded and placed in the Scale 500-1250, vide Government Order No, S&GAD-1/647-52/74, dated 6-61977. Prior to these two steps, the Planning and Development Department has intimated Muhammad Ashraf Khan, vide No, Dev-Gen(392)/2341/72, dated 156-1972 that the department proposed to offer job opportunities to the Engineer Graduates (Electrical/Mechanical) as Probationer Officers, in the scale 450-501.,000. This scale was later on termed as NPS-17. Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was required to appear for interview, before the Interview Board, on 3rd and 4th July, 1972. On 16-8-1972, Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was appointed as Planning Offices on a fixed pay of Rs,350 p.m. It was further indicated in the order dated 26-8-1972 that his appointment on a post of Econ.Omist or Statistical or Planning Officer shall be made on the recommendations of Public Service Commission, after he completes one year's training. On 13-7-1974, this officer was appointed as Planning Officer, in regular Pay Scale 350-925, from the date of appointment. The Pay Scale Rs,350-935 had been already revised to Rs,400-1,000. The scale of the post from 400-1,000 was converted to Rs,500-1,250 and Muhammad Ashraf Khan was allowed the benefit of the scale from 6-.6-1974, vide Government Order No, Admn.80-85/75, dated 11-1-1975. He was also allowed the benefit of running Pay Scale of Rs,350-925 with effect from the date of his first appointment/joining as Planning Officer, which was 30-8-1972. 4. Sardar Muhammad Ashraf Khan was transferred as Assistant Engineer Electrical in the Public Works Department, vide No, Admn. 1694-1701 dated 157-1974. On 1-12-1974, another order was passed by the Government for his transfer to the Planning and Development Department, although he was required to render the service, in the Public Works Department as Assistant Engineer Electricity. Practically, he never rejoined the Planning and Development Department. In 1976, he was placed under suspension, alongwith some other officers. He was shown as Assistant Engineer Electricity, in the suspension order. He was reinstated as Assistant Engineer Electricity in 1980. He has drawn pay from the Planning and Development Department upto 30-6-1976. He practically worked in the Public Works Department, even during this period, in the Public Works Deparment, a post was created in the Public Works Department, from 17-1976 to 10-3-1980 and he was paid his emoluments, for the aforesaid period, in his capacity as Assistant Engineer Electricity. He was required to appear before Public Service Commission, where he was approved for service as Assistant Engineer and order for the confirmation of his service, purports to have been issued on 20-1-1982. 5. The other officers joined the service as under:- #TBS Inayatullah Chaudhry. 9-12-1975 28-9-1978 Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi 28-9-1978 Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan 28-9-1978 Iqbal Mohiuddin 19-11-1975 Iqbal Ratyal 1-12-1974 #TBE Ad hoc basis. Regular basis. 27-7-1975 Ad hoc basis. Regular basis 30-6-1975 Work-charge basis. Regular basis. Shown to have been appointed on the basis of P.S.C. Recommendations. On the basis of recommendations of P.S.C. The appointments made between 24-8-1974 upto coming into force of Public Service Commission Functions Rules were required to be referred to the Public Service Commission, afresh because the Commission approving these appointments had not been constituted in accordance with law. Two other officers namely: Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan were also appointed as Assistant Engineer Electricity, alongwith Mr. Iqbal Ratyal in the similar circumstances. 6. The matter of determination of seniority of Assistant Engineers was entrusted by the Government to Secretary Works, vide order dated 6-7-1981, for scrutiny and report, who submitted the report on 18-8-1981. He placed Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, Inayatullah Chaudhry, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ilyas, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi and Mr. Muhammad Rashid respectively at S.Nos. 1 to 6 and submitted the case of the Chief Executive vide No, Works/4435-36/81, dated 18-8-1981, with an endorsement to Deputy Chief Engineer Electricity, for information of the concerned officers. Some objections were submitted to the Government. The President, who was also the Chief Executive, determined the seniority, vide impugned order dated 22-1-1983. The order is reproduced as under:- {{URDU TEXT}} ' Amongst the 6 Officers, mentioned hereinbefore, there was deviation, in the order dated 22-1-1983 from the report of Secretary Works dated 18-8-1981 to the effect that Iqbal Mohiuddin was shown at S.No: 2, instead of S.No, 3. Mr. Inayatullah Chaudhry was assigned S.No, 4, instead of S.No, 2. Mr. Ilyas was shifted to S.No, 5, instead of S.No, 4 and Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was placed at S.No, 3, instead of S. No,5. Positions of .Muhammad Ashraf Khan and Muhammad Rashid remained the same. It appears that Muhammad Ashraf was assigned the position, in seniority, with reference to the date of his first appointment, as Assistant Engineer, Electricity, with effect from 15-7-1974. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin who once appeared before the Public Service Commission, but was not appointed was assigned seniority from 19-11-1975, the date on which his appointment was ordered, against the clear vacancy, on the basis of recommendations of Public Service Commission. In the case of other 4 officers, the seniority was fixed, after excluding 6 months' period of service, from the date of the ad hoc appointment, on the impression that after 6 months, these officers held regular appointments. 7. Mr. Abdul Rashed Abbasi argued that review petition of his clients namely: Chaudhry Inayatullah and Iqbal Ratyal were pending with the Government. The decision of these petitions made on 31-7-1983 was not communicated till an application was submitted to the Chief Engineer, Electricity. On 3-3-1987, they were informed that their review petitions had been dismissed vide order dated 31-7-1983. Mr. Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan also stated that his client was informed of the result of the review petitions, vide letter dated 3-3-1987, therefore, according to them, limitation runs from 3-3-1987. As earlier pointed out, all the appellants contended that the service of Mr. Ashraf from 15-7-1974 to 20-1-1982 cannot be considered for the purpose of seniority, because he was not regularly appointed officer of the Electricity Department. According to Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi, the appointment in the Public Works Department, by transfer was to be made through Public Service Commission, in view of rule 17 of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Rules of Business 1977. He also argued that appointment of Mr. Ashraf Khan in a grade, equivalent to NPS-17 in Planning and Development Department was also ad hoc in the sense that he was approved by the Public Service Commission, for a post, equivalent to a grade, later on terms as NPS-16. There was no approval of Public Service Commission, when the post was up-graded and placed in scale 500-1200 from scale 400-1,000. The up-gradation, according to him is a promotion, requiring Public Service Commission's approval. He cited 1987 P L C 144 to support his contention. According to Mr. Abbasi, the appointment of Mr. Ashraf as Assistant Engineer, Electricity came to an end on 1-12-1974, when his services were transferred back to the Planning and Development Department. He, therefore, 'deserves seniority, with reference to 20-1-1982, the date of his regular appointment, in Electricity Department. The appellants' counsel also argued that there were 3 posts, in 1974, against which MA Mir Nazir Ahmad, Iqbal Ratyal and Muhammad Altaf Khan were appointed and no post was left for Muhammad Ashraf Khan, after 1-12-1974. There were 3 more posts in 1978, against which Chaudhry Inayatullah, Iqbal Mohiuddin and Ilyas Khan were appointed. There was no post for Muhammad Ashraf Khan or Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, which was the appointment of Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, which was initially ad hoc, from 1975 was changed to workcharge basis. Later on, a post was created and he was also appointed on regular basis, with effect from the date, the other 3 officers viz. Chaudhry Inayatullah, Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Iqbal Mohiuddin had been appointed. The reason for making the appointment of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, as workcharge on 28-9-1978 was that he held lower position, in the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission, while other 3 officers had better position. Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi, stated that appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was not retrospectively confirmed, vide order dated 20-1-1982, therefore, it should be treated as prospective. He cited the following authorities:- 1984 P L C 98 , 1164, 1982 P L C 94 , 1986 P L C 23, 525 and 883. 8. In the matter of Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, and Iqbal Mohiuddin, he relied on the provisions of Rule 8 of Azad. Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Appointment and Conditions of Service), Rules 1977 and stated that the names of these two officers should be placed below the appellant, on the basis of the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission. He cited the following authorities:- ' 1986 P L C 658 , 1984 SCMR 1023 , 1984 P L C 537 , 938, P L D 1962 AJ&K (S C) 124, P S C ACT (Act 17) of 1986 and 1987 P L C 307. 9. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi argued that he appeared before the Public Service Commission, in 1974 but in view of the contents of the recommendations, he cannot be treated to have been approved because only 5 candidates were approved, whereas the names of Iqbal Mohiuddin appeared at No, 6. He tried to distinguish the merit list from the approved list. 10. Sardar Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for Muhammad Ilyas argued more or less the same points, which were taken up by Mr. Abbasi. Additionally, he referred to the provisions of Art. 24, K.S.R. Vol. II, App. II and two extracts of the Government order dated 8-2-1979, pertaining to the seniority. (the extracts referred were not produced). 11. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed Advocate argued that in view of the provisions of section 9 of Public Service Commission Ordinance, promulgated in 1978, which has taken the shape of an Act in 1986, all appointments, made during 24-8-1974 to the date of coming into force of the Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules, were declared ad hoc, which were made without reference to the Public Service Commission. The appointments, which were made during the aforesaid period, after reference to the Public Service Commission, were also required to be re-examined, for ascertaining the suitability, for the posts, held by such officers. This latter provision is aimed at regularizing the appointments, made on the recommendations of the Public Service Commission, which was not legally constituted. According to Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, if the provisions of section 9, strictly applied, the appointments of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir, Muhammad Altaf Khan and Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal also require reference to Public Service Commission, because they have not been declared suitable for the posts, so far. 12. (i) In the matter of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, his counsel argued that his appointment was made, in the Department, on 15-7-1974. Thereafter, he never worked in the Planning and Development Department. The only factor that he received pay from 1-12-1974 to 30-6-1976, from Planning and Development Department does not deprive him, from the seniority, in the department, in which he practically worked. He was suspended from the service, in the capacity of Assistant Engineer Electricity and reinstated as such. He was paid as Assistant Engineei, Electricity, from 1-7-1976. In these circumstances, he was continously holding the post of Assistant Engineer, Electricity. According to the learned counsel, the provisions, relating to approval by the Public Service Commission were not attracted in the case of Muhammad Ashraf Khan, because he was a regularly appointed officer, in the Planning and Development Department and that no approval was required, in the matter of transfer to an equivalent post. (ii) It was argued that transfer of Muhammad Ashraf Khan to Planning and Development Department on 1-12-1974 was made on paper only, for the purpose of pay. His case would have been regularized much earlier, had he not been involved in a false case. Therefore, he is to be treated as an officer of the Electricity Department throughout and seniority 'shall have to be determined, from the date of his first appointment in terms of Art. 24, K.S.R. Vol. II. Appendix II. He cited 1971 P L C 88, 86, 1977 P L C 18 and 1974 P L C (?). Regarding the availability of post, in the Department, Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was made, against the clear vacancy on 15-7-1974. Another post was also created from 1-7-1976 to 10-3-1980. Except for the purpose of pay from 1-12-1974 to 30-6-1976, Mr. Ashraf occupied a post in the Electricity Department throughout this period. The period of suspension from 3-7-1976 to 5-8-1979 was also treated as duty, with full pay, in the Electricity Department. The Public Service Commission Function Rules were made effective from 24-8-1974, therefore, no approval of Public Service Commission was necessary after 24-8-1974, in respect of an officer, whose appointment by transfer remains effective after that date, except the cases, which were covered by the provisions of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance. 13. In respect of Iqbal Mohiuddin, he submitted that he was approved, for appointment in 1974. His appointment order shows that the appointment was made on the basis of the recommendations .Of Public Service Commission. If due to any legal defect, in constitution of Commission, his case was referred again to the Commission, the nature of appointment is not affected. The seniority has been rightly assigned in his case. 14. Regarding Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, again it was argued that his service was treated ad hoc for a period of 6 months and thereafter, the Government was competent to confirm him, from any earlier date, or after the expiry of the normal period of a hoc service, stipulated by rules. The learned counsel contended that Governmen could assign seniority from any date, even earlier than the date of entry into s rvice. He shall be deemed to have been confirmed with effect from 30-1-1976, ide order dated 22-1-1983. He cited 1971 P L C 47 , 220, P L D 1968 S C 37 and 1975 SCMR 505 . 15. In respect of Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal, Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that he had brought an appeal, alongwith Muhammad Altaf Khan and Muhammad Nazir but had given up its prosecution, without the permission for re-institution of the appeal. According to him, Mr. Iqbal Ratyal is now precluded from bringing another appeal, on the basis of same cause of action. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that in the earlier appeal, before the Tribunal, it was indicated b Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal that he got the information of the order, pertaining t seniority, in May, 1986 whereas he had already submitted the review petition, a ainst order dated 22-1-1983, in February, 1983. In the subsequent appeal, he as taken a different stand from one, taken at the earlier stage. His conduct shows that he was aware of the orders, under appeal, but failed to bring the appeal, at the appropriate time. 16. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate for the respondents also contended that no representation was made by the appellants, against the seniority, proposed by the Secretary Works, in spite of the fact that it was circulated to all concerned. He stated that Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was promoted as Executive Engineer on 18-4-1983 and held the appointment on acting basis, prior to that. The order of rejection of review petition is stated to have been sent, by the services Department, through the office of Chief Engineer. The appellants had the knowledge of order dated 31-7-1983. He referred to the statement of Muhammad Ashraf and Chaudhry Ali Muhammad, Section Officer examined in this behalf. He argued that if there is a positive evidence, on one side and no rebuttal on the other side, the facts positively alleged should be treated to have been proved. It was stated that copy of order dated 31-7-1983 is shown to have been despatched to Muhammad Ilyas Khan as per entry in the Peon Book, the copy Whereof has been placed on record. The other two appellants were serving in the office of the Chief Engineer. They received the copy of the order personally, without acknowledgment, from the office of Chief Engineer, to which it was despatched by the services Department. The appeals should, therefore, be dismissed as time-barred. He cited the following authorities:- ' P L D 1982 A J& K (S C) 13, 110. ' P L D 1983 S C (AJ&K) 31, ' 1978 SCMR 207 , ' 1979 P L C (C.S.T.) 47, 1986 SCMR 1086 , N L R 1978 Services 157. ' N L R 1979 Services 256, 1985 P L C (C.S.) 951, 1980 P L C (C.S.) 401, 680(2), N L R 1979 Services 208. ' P L D 1974 S C 344 , ' 1978 P L C 77 , 1971 P L C 178 , 1986 SCMRI2, P L ' ' 1977 S C 599 and ' P L D 1979 S C 167. ' He argued that there was no application, for condonation of delay. Under the provisions of section 5, each day's delay is to be explained. 17. Mr. Abdul Rashid, in replication argued that communication of order dated 31-7-1983 or 22-1-1983 is not established. According to him, the limitation does not run, unless an order is communicated to the officer, as envisaged by section 4 of the Service Tribunals Act 1975. He, contended that there is no proof of communication of order to Chaudhry Inayatullah and Igbal Ratyal. He referred to the statement of Sheikh Ghulam Muhammad, Administrative Officer, Electricity Department, who denied the receipt of the spare copies of the order dated 31-7-1983, in Chief Engineer, Electricity's Office, for distribution to the concerned officers. According to the learned counsel, the oral statements of Muhammad Ashraf and Ali Muhammad do not go to prove the communication. He cited 1985 C L C 937, 940 and 1984 C L C 1009. In the matter of competence of appeal, it was stated that no objection was taken in the pleading by the respondent. Apart from that, the promotion of Muhammad Ashraf Khan to the post of Executive Engineer was not made, after considering the appellants, therefore, according to him, the appeal was competent. He cited 1980 C L C 789 to prove that a void order can be ignored. Mr. Abbasi argued that appointment of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin, made on 19-11-1975 was wrongly shown to have been made, on the basis of the Public Service Commission's recommendation. In fact, he had not been approved by the Public Service Commission, rather his name appeared in the merit list. The approval of this officer was given, by the Public Service Commission, in 1978, alongwith other 3 officers. In the merit, he possessed the position, lower than the appellant Chaudhry Inayatullah; hence he should be declared junior. 18. Sardar Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for the appellant Muhammad Ilyas Khan argued that communication of order dated 31-7-1983 is not established. The statements of Mr. Sheikh Ghulam Muhammad and Ali Muhammad, witnesses produced by the parties contradicted each other's statements, hence a valuable right of appeal cannot be forfeited on the basis of such evidence, which transpires no confidence. He reiterated that seniority should be determined in accordance with the rules, enforced in 1977 as the earlier appointments made on ad hoc basis do not confer any right, for seniority. In the case of Muhammad Ashraf Khan, it was argued hat benefit of NPS-17 allowed to him was also a case of promotion, which was n t regular. He cited 1987 P L C 144 to show that up-gradation of post amounts to promotion and requires the approval of prescribed selection authority, which was lacking in this case. 19. We have considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties. The case of seniority inter se Chaudhry Inayatullah, Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Mushtaq Ahinad Gorsi is simple. Their case was considered by the Public Service Commission at one and the same meeting and recommended for appointment. The appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Chaudhry Inayatullah was made again t clear vacancies on 28-9-1978. Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was absorbed on work charge basis but after creation of a post, he was also given a retrospective benefit of regular appointment from 28-9-1978. Thus, the date of regular appointment of these 3 officers is one and the same. Under the rules, the appointment on ad hoc basis carries no right for seniority as clearly provided for in rule 23 of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Appointment and Conditions of Service Rules) 1977, reproduced below:- "23.- (1) When a post is required to be filled, the Appointing Authority shall fo and a requisition to the Selection Authority, immediately after deci ion is taken to fill the post. (2) Afte forwarding a requisition to the Selection Authority, the Appointing Aut ority may, if it considers necessary in the Public interest, fill the post on d hoc basis for a period not exceeding six months pending nom nation of a candidate by the Selection Authority: ' Provided (i) .................................. (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) ' Provided further that ad hoc appointment shall not confer any right on the ersons so appointed in the matter of regular appointment to the sam post nor the service will count towards seniority in the grade." The appointment of these 3 officers was ad hoc/workcharge in view of their appointment 'order as well as on the face of section 9 of the Public Service g Commission Ordinance. The regular appointment was made after enforcement of the rules, framed in 1977. The relevant provision governing their seniority is embodied in rule 8, which is reproduced below:- "8. The seniority inter se of persons appointed to post in the same grade in a Functional Unit shall be determined:- (1) (a) In the case of persons appointed by initial recruitment, in accordance with the order of merit, assigned by the Selection Authority; ' Provided that persons, selected for appointment to the grade in an earlier selection shall rank senior to the persons selected in a later selection;" In view of the contents of rule 8, the seniority inter se of these 3 officers will be determined o the basis of merit, assigne.d by the Selection Authority namely; the C Public Service Commission. We have also examined the record of the Public Service Commission, as well as the Government order dated 28-9-1978, whereby the regular appointments of these officers were made. The Government had by this order accepted the recommendations of Public Service Commission, without any deviation. He sequence in the order of appointment, which conforms to the merit, assigned on 11-6-1978 by Public Service Commission, is as under:-(1) Inayatullah Chaudhry. (2) Mr. Iqbal Mohi-ud-Din. (3) Mr. Muhammad Ilyas. (4) Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi. 20. The Government appears to have fallen in error in assuming that only a period of 6. Months' service is to be treated as ad hoc, thereafter it was regular, even. Without the approval of the prescribed Selection Authority. This is a wrong interpretation of Rule 13. A decision of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Supreme Court in the case of Rafiq Akhtar Chaudhry P L D 1982 AJ&K (S C) 124 is also misconstrued in this respect. Actually, the Supreme Court opined that after expiry of 6 months, any civil servant cannot be deprived of his appointment, without show-cause notice. This Tribunal has already turned down the case of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, for the purpose of. Seniority, on the basis of ad hoc appointment. It is lawful for the Government to appoint the Civil servants, on any terms and conditions, it likes. The appointment of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was subject to the approval of Public Service Commission. The appointment of Muhammad Ilyas was on workcharge basis, prior to 28-9-1978. All appointments made after 24th day of August, 1974 and before coming into force of Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules without reference to Public Service Commission, were also declared ad hoc. Therefore, the appointment of any of these officers, prior to 28-9-1978 does not bestow any right for seniority. It was lawful for the Government to confirm any person in service, from an earlier date, from which such officer held any appointment, on officiating basis. No such confirmation order appears to have been ever passed in respect of any of these officers. The contention Of Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate, for assigning seniority from any earlier date, except the cases covered by Explanation to Rule 7(1) does not fit in the scheme of service laws applied in Azad Kashmir. The presumption of confirmation cannot be drawn, without specific order. Therefore, the order of merit is the only criteria available, for determination of their inter se seniority. We, therefore, accordingly hold that inter se seniority of these 3 officers shall be determined as under:- (1) Inayatullah Chaudhry. (2) Muhammad Ilyas Khan. (3) Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi. 21. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, the provisions of section 9(a) do not apply in the sense in which their application is possible in the case of other 3 officers. Section 9(a) and (b) is reproduced below:- "9(a)All persons recruited without reference to the Commission to the posts prescribed under section 7 at any time between twenty-fourth day of August, 1974 and coming into force of the Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules framed immediately after promulgation of this Ordinance, shall be deemed to be ad hoc appointments and the post held by any such person shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, within such period, not exceeding six months, as may be fixed by the Government by a special or general order; (b) Aft recruitments other than those mentioned in clause (a) to the posts piiescribed under section 7 at any time between twenty-fourth day of August, 1974, and coming into force of the Public Service Commission (finctions) Rules framed immediately after promulgation of this Ordinance shall be referred to the Commission and if in the opinion of the Commission, a person recruited to any such post, is not fit to hold that post, he may be discharged from service;" ' The appointment, vide order dated 19-11-1975 was not made subject to any condition in the order. His case is not of "Appointment without reference to Public Service Commission" so it comes under subsection (b) of section 9 of Public Service Commission Ordinance and had been alyeady examined by the Public Service Commission. His name appeared in the merit list of the candidates, for the post of Assistant Engineer, Electricity, prepared by the Public Service Commission, in 1974. The cases of officers, who were appointed to service after reference to Public Service Commission even though they were not recommended by the Commission, were to be referred only for the purpose of determination of suitability. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin was not declared ad hoc, through the order of his appointment, nor any rule, requiring the approval of Public Service Commission was applicable on the relevant date namely; 19-11-1975. The Public Service Commission Ordinance enforced later on, only enjoins upon the authority, concerned to have the suitability of these officers, determined afresh, through Public Service Commission. Therefore, such officer could not be deprived of his seniority, as he was found suitable by the Public Service Co mission, at the later stage. The requirement of subsection (b) of section 9 o Public Service Commission Ordinance (which has now become an Act of the ssembly) was complied with. This officer thus stands confirmed in service, on the basis of the order of his appointment and the provisions of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance from the date, he joined the service. He was rightly placed in seniority, above the 3 officers, whose case has been discussed in paragraph 20 of this judgment. 22. It will not be out of place to mention that the constitution of the Commission, which examined the cases on 23rd and 24th July, 1974 was not in dispute. That was lawfully constituted Commission. The Commission, which was constituted subsequently was not lawfully constituted as per opinion of the Supreme Court. There was no legislation, regarding Public Service Commission. On promulgation of Public Service Commission Ordinance, actually the appointments made on the recommendations of the subsequent disputed Commission were to be re-examined, but due to bad drafting of the Ordinance, even the cases wherein the appointment orders on the recommendations of the earlier Comknission were issued after 24-8-1974 were also hit by the provisions of section 9(b). Otherwise there is no justification, for referring the cases, which were considered by the Commission, lawfully constituted. Thus, the reexamination of case of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin and others, which came up for consideration, before the Public Service Commission, even prior to 24-8-1974, was not necessary and should not have been brought within the miss-chief of subsection (13) of section 9. Position of the cases considered by the subsequent Commission is distinguishable that this Commission was constituted without the lawful authority of the President. 23. In the case of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, assuming that he holds continuous appointment from 1-7-1976, the date from which he is receiving his emoluments and performing duty, in the Electricity Department, he is still senior to the appellant Chaudhry Inayatullah as well as to Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan. His case is also not of ad hoc appointment, in view of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance, nor under the rules, enforced in 1977 because he was already holding the post in NPS-17 in the Planning and Development Department, when he was transferred to Electricity Department. The Public Service Commission's Functions Rules, which took effect from 24-8-1974, do not provide for any reference to the Commission, in the matter of transfers to an equal post, rather there is clear exception, for such cases, as is clear from rule 6, which is reproduced below:- "6. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 3, the Commission shall not conduct test for recruitment to posts which are filled- (i) (ii) ...................................................... (a) ............... (b) ............... (iii) by transfer of an officer of the Armed Forces or an officer already holding a post on regular basis in equivalent grade under the Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council or under the Federal or Provincial Government of Pakistan." ' The transfer of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, even if held to have taken effect from 1-7-1976, requires no action at the hands of Public Service Commission. His approval by Public Service Commission in 1981 and the issuance of another order in his case on 20-1-1982 are superfluous. He cannot be deprived of his service for the purpose of seniority from 1-7-1976. The claim of M/s. Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Chaudhry Inayatullah, who hold regular appointment with effect from 28-9-1978, merits no consideration. It is not necessary to discuss the nature of appointment of Muhammad Ashraf in the Electricity Department, which had originated on 15-7-1974, while disposing of the appeals of Chaudhry Inayatullah and Mr. Ilyas Khan. His position, in the impugned order shall, therefore, remain undisturbed so far as the appellants are concerned. On other hand, his case for seniority from 15-7-1974 merits consideration. 24. Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal has also brought an appeal against the orders dated 22-1-1983 and 31-7-1983. He had brought an appeal, jointly with Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, on 1-6-1986 but later on, he applied for the withdrawal of that appeal on 4-2-1987. His name thus, stood struck off, from the appellants, in that appeal, from the aforesaid date. He did not seek permission of this Tribunal, for bringing fresh appeal. It was argued by Khawaja Muhammad Saeed that he is precluded from bringing another appeal, for seniority against Muhammad Ashraf Khan, who was also a party in the previous case. Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi argued that Mr. Iqbal Ratyal had a right of appeal, after issuance of order dated 22-1-1983 as well as after order dated 31-7-1983. The earlier appeal was brought against order dated 22-1-1983 and not against order datdd 31-1-1983, therefore, his right against order dated 31-7-1983 is not extinguished. We have noticed that the Appeal No, 320, dated 1-6-1986 was brought by Mr. Iqbal Ratyal, jointly with Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Kh when both the orders had been already passed. The cause of action against or er dated 22-1-1983 as well as order dated 31-7-1983 is the same. The facts cons ituting seniority of the 2 officers are same, for calling in question the order dat d 22-1-1983 as well as order dated 31-7-1983. The mere fact that another order was passed on 31-7-1983 has not given Mr. Iqbal Ratyal a right, for seniority, nor it has improved his status, in this matter. He could avail of a remedy, either against order dated 22-1-1983 or after waiting for the result of his review petition, he could come with an appeal against order dated 31-7-1983. No second appeal on the same facts is maintainable, in respect of which a case was closed at an earlier stage. The fact that the order dated 31-7-1983 was not in his knowledge is no ground to reopen a matter, which stands closed. The stand taken by the appllant, regarding the knowledge in respect of order dated 22-1-1983 is also contradictory. In the earlier appeal, he stated that he got the information of order dated 22-1-1983 in May, 1986 whereas in the second appeal, he stated that order dated 22-1-1983 came to his knowledge in February, 1983. In fact, he had concealed he fact of his knowledge in the earlier appeal. On being opposed by respondent Muhammad Ashraf Khan, on this point, he realized his weakness and gave up the appeal, for paving out a way for coming up with a different stand with respect to order dated 22-1-1983. Whether a case is decided on merit or disposed of on technical basis, it puts an end to the controversy between the parties. The act of giving up of the earlier appeal by Mr. Iqbal Ratyal has put an end to his right for a remedy, through the Service Tribunal. His appeal, therefore, merits dismissal. Of course, this order will not stand in his way, if the case of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf is dealt with in any other way, in the appeal of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, by the other bench of the Service Tribunal, before which that case is pending. The decision in that case about the nature of appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf will operate, even in the case of Mr. Iqbal Ratyal, because the appointment of these 3 officers has been made on the same date and their case is inseparable. -25. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin has not challenged the date of appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, nor any other officer, having a patent case of seniority, against this officer has come up with an appeal against him, therefore, it is not necessary to discuss the date from which Mr. Muhammad Ashraf is entitled to seniority, in this department. Even otherwise his case is complicated and needs interpretation of 'Art. 24, K.S.R., the effect of Public Service Commission Functions Rules and the effect of repeal of Rules of Business 1971. The Court is not supposed to decide a matter, the determination of which is not necessary for the disposal of a case, before it. The term Ratio Decidendi has been discussed by the Azad Jmmu and Kashmir, S.C. In this respect, in the case of Raja Muhammad Ni Khan v. Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government. This matter can be exa coed in detail in an appropriate case, whether for the purpose, his seniority should be determined, with effect from 15-7-1974, the date of his first appointment in the department or from 1-7-1976 from which he holds the continuous appointment. The entry shown in respect of service of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf in the impugned order, therefore, needs no change at this stage. As a result, the position of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Iqbal Mohiuddin and Muhammad Rashid shall remain the same, as incorporated in the Government order dated 22-1-1983. Chaudhry Inayatullah, Muhammad Ilyas and Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi shall stand at S.Nos. 3, 4 and 5 respectively. 26. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate for the respondents had made casual remarks in respect of appointment of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan and Igbal' Ratyal to show that their appointments were also not regular and require examination, by Public Service Commission, as envisaged by subsection (b) of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance. The appointment order dated 1-12-1974, passed in the case of the aforesaid 3 officers is not subject of appeals, before us. It has been otherwise argued as well as noticed by us that their cases were considered by Public Service Commission, although the recommendations of Public Service Commission, made in 1974 were not accepted, in toto, by the President, who was the Appointing Authority, in the case of Assistant Engineers, Electricity, at the relevant time. The worthy President, after the receipt of the recommendations, laid down yard-stick of his own, in the following form, as there were no departmental service rules, at that time:- (a) The persons employed on work-charge basis, in the department shall be preferred, for regular appointment to all others; (b) the persons. Who were out of employment, will be preferred to those, who are having appointment in other departments. ' On the basis of the aforesaid principle, Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir, Muhammad Altaf Khan and Iqbal Ratyal already working in the departments were appointed. Thus, the recommendations of Public Service Commission stood, overruled to this extent. So far as the requirement of Public Service Commission Ordinance is concerned, it needs no discussion, because no person has come up with a claim, through appropriate proceedings, for seniority against these 3 officers. The Tribunal is not supposed to give finding on an issue, not brought before it, in due process of law. The observation of the learned counsel has, therefore, no bearing with this case. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, we have already given our view, in the earlier part of this judgment, in response to the arguments of the learned counsel. 27. In the matter of limitation, we considered the arguments of Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate, for the respondents. The impugned order dated 31-7-1983 purports to have been despatched to all concerned but it does not show the address, on which it was communicated to the officers. No presumption of service, therefore, arises either under C.P.C. Or Evidence Act, in such a case. Ali Muhammad, Section Officer, Services Department stated that the copies of the order were despatched to the Chief Engineer, Electricity but no proof of the further service of the letter, on Mr. Inayatullah Chaudhry and Iqbal Mohiuddin has been adduced. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan is shown to have received the copy of the order through some peon. The photostat copy of the peon book has been produced, but it is not corroborated by the Despatch Register of Chief Engineer's Office. Even if one appeal succeeds on merits, in the matter of seniority, the other persons, whose case is not separable, cannot be deprived of the result. No contradictory decisions can co-exist, in one and the same case. In order to avoid contradiction, even under Order XLI, Rule 33, C.P.C. a decree can be passed, in favour of a party, who has not appealed against a judgment, as held by our High Court, in the case Ghulam Hussain v. Asila Begum P L D 1978 AJ&K 1 . For these reasons, the appeal of Mr. Ilyas Khan cannot be dismissed on the ground of Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, due to identical facts. His appeal merits dismissal, On the ground of withdrawal of earlier appeal. The objection, with regard to the limitation, therefore, does not sustain. The case law cited by the learend counsel for the parties has been perused but it dOes not require discussion, in detail, for the view, we have taken. 28 As upshot of the above discussion, the appeal of Mr. Iqbal Ratyal is dismissed. The appeals of Chaudhry Inayatullah and Muhammad Ilyas Khan are accepted to the extent, indicated above. The Governmetn shall maintain seniority, as indicated in paragraphs 19 and 25 of this judgment. There is no order as to the COST. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.

Court Name: Azad Jammu and Kashmir Service Tribunal Judge(s): Muhammad Siddique Farooqi, Sardar Mushtaq Ahmad Khan Title: INAYATULLAH CHAUDHRY and others vs AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR GOVERNMENT through its Chief Secretary and others Case No.: Appeals Nos. 356, 358 and 359 of 1987 Appeal No, 358 of 1987 Date of Judgment: 1988-04-05 Reported As: 1988 P L C (C.S.) 846 Result: Appeal accepted Judgment JUDGMENT ' MUHAMMAD SIDDIQUE FAROOQI (CHAIRMAN).--The above 3 appeals have been brought against order of the Government, passed on 22-1-1983, whereby the seniority of some Assistant Engineers (Electricity) was etermined and order dated 31-7-1983, through which the review petitions of the appellants were rejected. The main grievance of the appellants is common, against Sardar Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Executive Engineer, to the effect that he was approved for the post of Assistant Engineer Electricity in 1981 and his appointment was confirmed as such on 20-1-1982 but the seniority, in his case has been determined with effect from 15-7-1974. According to the appellants, the appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, made on 15-7-1974, was of ad hoc nature and the same came to an end, when the said respondent was transferred back to his present department, namely, Planning and Development. According to the appellants, the seniority of Muhammad Ashraf as Assistant Engineer Electricity could be determined with effect from 20-1-1982, when according to them, his regular appointment was ordered. 2. Chaudhry Inayatullah also attacked the order, on the ground that seniority of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin and Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was illegally determined. According to him, his name preceded in the merit lists, the names of these two officers, therefore, seniority should have been determined according to the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission and not on the basis of the Ad hoc appointment, held by these officers. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas claims seniority against Mushtaq Ahmed Gorsi on the basis of merit assigned at the time of selection. The seniority of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan has been challenged in all the three appeals. Mr. Iqbal Ratyal has the grievance in matter of the seniority only against Muhammad Ashraf Khan. 3. The facts of the case as noticed by us are that Muhammad Ashraf Khan was holding a post of Planning Officer, in the Planning and Development Department, in Pay Scale 400-1000. His post was up-graded and placed in the Scale 500-1250, vide Government Order No, S&GAD-1/647-52/74, dated 6-61977. Prior to these two steps, the Planning and Development Department has intimated Muhammad Ashraf Khan, vide No, Dev-Gen(392)/2341/72, dated 156-1972 that the department proposed to offer job opportunities to the Engineer Graduates (Electrical/Mechanical) as Probationer Officers, in the scale 450-501.,000. This scale was later on termed as NPS-17. Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was required to appear for interview, before the Interview Board, on 3rd and 4th July, 1972. On 16-8-1972, Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was appointed as Planning Offices on a fixed pay of Rs,350 p.m. It was further indicated in the order dated 26-8-1972 that his appointment on a post of Econ.Omist or Statistical or Planning Officer shall be made on the recommendations of Public Service Commission, after he completes one year's training. On 13-7-1974, this officer was appointed as Planning Officer, in regular Pay Scale 350-925, from the date of appointment. The Pay Scale Rs,350-935 had been already revised to Rs,400-1,000. The scale of the post from 400-1,000 was converted to Rs,500-1,250 and Muhammad Ashraf Khan was allowed the benefit of the scale from 6-.6-1974, vide Government Order No, Admn.80-85/75, dated 11-1-1975. He was also allowed the benefit of running Pay Scale of Rs,350-925 with effect from the date of his first appointment/joining as Planning Officer, which was 30-8-1972. 4. Sardar Muhammad Ashraf Khan was transferred as Assistant Engineer Electrical in the Public Works Department, vide No, Admn. 1694-1701 dated 157-1974. On 1-12-1974, another order was passed by the Government for his transfer to the Planning and Development Department, although he was required to render the service, in the Public Works Department as Assistant Engineer Electricity. Practically, he never rejoined the Planning and Development Department. In 1976, he was placed under suspension, alongwith some other officers. He was shown as Assistant Engineer Electricity, in the suspension order. He was reinstated as Assistant Engineer Electricity in 1980. He has drawn pay from the Planning and Development Department upto 30-6-1976. He practically worked in the Public Works Department, even during this period, in the Public Works Deparment, a post was created in the Public Works Department, from 17-1976 to 10-3-1980 and he was paid his emoluments, for the aforesaid period, in his capacity as Assistant Engineer Electricity. He was required to appear before Public Service Commission, where he was approved for service as Assistant Engineer and order for the confirmation of his service, purports to have been issued on 20-1-1982. 5. The other officers joined the service as under:- #TBS Inayatullah Chaudhry. 9-12-1975 28-9-1978 Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi 28-9-1978 Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan 28-9-1978 Iqbal Mohiuddin 19-11-1975 Iqbal Ratyal 1-12-1974 #TBE Ad hoc basis. Regular basis. 27-7-1975 Ad hoc basis. Regular basis 30-6-1975 Work-charge basis. Regular basis. Shown to have been appointed on the basis of P.S.C. Recommendations. On the basis of recommendations of P.S.C. The appointments made between 24-8-1974 upto coming into force of Public Service Commission Functions Rules were required to be referred to the Public Service Commission, afresh because the Commission approving these appointments had not been constituted in accordance with law. Two other officers namely: Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan were also appointed as Assistant Engineer Electricity, alongwith Mr. Iqbal Ratyal in the similar circumstances. 6. The matter of determination of seniority of Assistant Engineers was entrusted by the Government to Secretary Works, vide order dated 6-7-1981, for scrutiny and report, who submitted the report on 18-8-1981. He placed Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, Inayatullah Chaudhry, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ilyas, Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi and Mr. Muhammad Rashid respectively at S.Nos. 1 to 6 and submitted the case of the Chief Executive vide No, Works/4435-36/81, dated 18-8-1981, with an endorsement to Deputy Chief Engineer Electricity, for information of the concerned officers. Some objections were submitted to the Government. The President, who was also the Chief Executive, determined the seniority, vide impugned order dated 22-1-1983. The order is reproduced as under:- {{URDU TEXT}} ' Amongst the 6 Officers, mentioned hereinbefore, there was deviation, in the order dated 22-1-1983 from the report of Secretary Works dated 18-8-1981 to the effect that Iqbal Mohiuddin was shown at S.No: 2, instead of S.No, 3. Mr. Inayatullah Chaudhry was assigned S.No, 4, instead of S.No, 2. Mr. Ilyas was shifted to S.No, 5, instead of S.No, 4 and Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was placed at S.No, 3, instead of S. No,5. Positions of .Muhammad Ashraf Khan and Muhammad Rashid remained the same. It appears that Muhammad Ashraf was assigned the position, in seniority, with reference to the date of his first appointment, as Assistant Engineer, Electricity, with effect from 15-7-1974. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin who once appeared before the Public Service Commission, but was not appointed was assigned seniority from 19-11-1975, the date on which his appointment was ordered, against the clear vacancy, on the basis of recommendations of Public Service Commission. In the case of other 4 officers, the seniority was fixed, after excluding 6 months' period of service, from the date of the ad hoc appointment, on the impression that after 6 months, these officers held regular appointments. 7. Mr. Abdul Rashed Abbasi argued that review petition of his clients namely: Chaudhry Inayatullah and Iqbal Ratyal were pending with the Government. The decision of these petitions made on 31-7-1983 was not communicated till an application was submitted to the Chief Engineer, Electricity. On 3-3-1987, they were informed that their review petitions had been dismissed vide order dated 31-7-1983. Mr. Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan also stated that his client was informed of the result of the review petitions, vide letter dated 3-3-1987, therefore, according to them, limitation runs from 3-3-1987. As earlier pointed out, all the appellants contended that the service of Mr. Ashraf from 15-7-1974 to 20-1-1982 cannot be considered for the purpose of seniority, because he was not regularly appointed officer of the Electricity Department. According to Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi, the appointment in the Public Works Department, by transfer was to be made through Public Service Commission, in view of rule 17 of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Rules of Business 1977. He also argued that appointment of Mr. Ashraf Khan in a grade, equivalent to NPS-17 in Planning and Development Department was also ad hoc in the sense that he was approved by the Public Service Commission, for a post, equivalent to a grade, later on terms as NPS-16. There was no approval of Public Service Commission, when the post was up-graded and placed in scale 500-1200 from scale 400-1,000. The up-gradation, according to him is a promotion, requiring Public Service Commission's approval. He cited 1987 P L C 144 to support his contention. According to Mr. Abbasi, the appointment of Mr. Ashraf as Assistant Engineer, Electricity came to an end on 1-12-1974, when his services were transferred back to the Planning and Development Department. He, therefore, 'deserves seniority, with reference to 20-1-1982, the date of his regular appointment, in Electricity Department. The appellants' counsel also argued that there were 3 posts, in 1974, against which MA Mir Nazir Ahmad, Iqbal Ratyal and Muhammad Altaf Khan were appointed and no post was left for Muhammad Ashraf Khan, after 1-12-1974. There were 3 more posts in 1978, against which Chaudhry Inayatullah, Iqbal Mohiuddin and Ilyas Khan were appointed. There was no post for Muhammad Ashraf Khan or Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, which was the appointment of Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, which was initially ad hoc, from 1975 was changed to workcharge basis. Later on, a post was created and he was also appointed on regular basis, with effect from the date, the other 3 officers viz. Chaudhry Inayatullah, Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Iqbal Mohiuddin had been appointed. The reason for making the appointment of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, as workcharge on 28-9-1978 was that he held lower position, in the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission, while other 3 officers had better position. Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi, stated that appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was not retrospectively confirmed, vide order dated 20-1-1982, therefore, it should be treated as prospective. He cited the following authorities:- 1984 P L C 98 , 1164, 1982 P L C 94 , 1986 P L C 23, 525 and 883. 8. In the matter of Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, and Iqbal Mohiuddin, he relied on the provisions of Rule 8 of Azad. Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Appointment and Conditions of Service), Rules 1977 and stated that the names of these two officers should be placed below the appellant, on the basis of the merit assigned by the Public Service Commission. He cited the following authorities:- ' 1986 P L C 658 , 1984 SCMR 1023 , 1984 P L C 537 , 938, P L D 1962 AJ&K (S C) 124, P S C ACT (Act 17) of 1986 and 1987 P L C 307. 9. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi argued that he appeared before the Public Service Commission, in 1974 but in view of the contents of the recommendations, he cannot be treated to have been approved because only 5 candidates were approved, whereas the names of Iqbal Mohiuddin appeared at No, 6. He tried to distinguish the merit list from the approved list. 10. Sardar Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for Muhammad Ilyas argued more or less the same points, which were taken up by Mr. Abbasi. Additionally, he referred to the provisions of Art. 24, K.S.R. Vol. II, App. II and two extracts of the Government order dated 8-2-1979, pertaining to the seniority. (the extracts referred were not produced). 11. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed Advocate argued that in view of the provisions of section 9 of Public Service Commission Ordinance, promulgated in 1978, which has taken the shape of an Act in 1986, all appointments, made during 24-8-1974 to the date of coming into force of the Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules, were declared ad hoc, which were made without reference to the Public Service Commission. The appointments, which were made during the aforesaid period, after reference to the Public Service Commission, were also required to be re-examined, for ascertaining the suitability, for the posts, held by such officers. This latter provision is aimed at regularizing the appointments, made on the recommendations of the Public Service Commission, which was not legally constituted. According to Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, if the provisions of section 9, strictly applied, the appointments of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir, Muhammad Altaf Khan and Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal also require reference to Public Service Commission, because they have not been declared suitable for the posts, so far. 12. (i) In the matter of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, his counsel argued that his appointment was made, in the Department, on 15-7-1974. Thereafter, he never worked in the Planning and Development Department. The only factor that he received pay from 1-12-1974 to 30-6-1976, from Planning and Development Department does not deprive him, from the seniority, in the department, in which he practically worked. He was suspended from the service, in the capacity of Assistant Engineer Electricity and reinstated as such. He was paid as Assistant Engineei, Electricity, from 1-7-1976. In these circumstances, he was continously holding the post of Assistant Engineer, Electricity. According to the learned counsel, the provisions, relating to approval by the Public Service Commission were not attracted in the case of Muhammad Ashraf Khan, because he was a regularly appointed officer, in the Planning and Development Department and that no approval was required, in the matter of transfer to an equivalent post. (ii) It was argued that transfer of Muhammad Ashraf Khan to Planning and Development Department on 1-12-1974 was made on paper only, for the purpose of pay. His case would have been regularized much earlier, had he not been involved in a false case. Therefore, he is to be treated as an officer of the Electricity Department throughout and seniority 'shall have to be determined, from the date of his first appointment in terms of Art. 24, K.S.R. Vol. II. Appendix II. He cited 1971 P L C 88, 86, 1977 P L C 18 and 1974 P L C (?). Regarding the availability of post, in the Department, Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was made, against the clear vacancy on 15-7-1974. Another post was also created from 1-7-1976 to 10-3-1980. Except for the purpose of pay from 1-12-1974 to 30-6-1976, Mr. Ashraf occupied a post in the Electricity Department throughout this period. The period of suspension from 3-7-1976 to 5-8-1979 was also treated as duty, with full pay, in the Electricity Department. The Public Service Commission Function Rules were made effective from 24-8-1974, therefore, no approval of Public Service Commission was necessary after 24-8-1974, in respect of an officer, whose appointment by transfer remains effective after that date, except the cases, which were covered by the provisions of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance. 13. In respect of Iqbal Mohiuddin, he submitted that he was approved, for appointment in 1974. His appointment order shows that the appointment was made on the basis of the recommendations .Of Public Service Commission. If due to any legal defect, in constitution of Commission, his case was referred again to the Commission, the nature of appointment is not affected. The seniority has been rightly assigned in his case. 14. Regarding Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, again it was argued that his service was treated ad hoc for a period of 6 months and thereafter, the Government was competent to confirm him, from any earlier date, or after the expiry of the normal period of a hoc service, stipulated by rules. The learned counsel contended that Governmen could assign seniority from any date, even earlier than the date of entry into s rvice. He shall be deemed to have been confirmed with effect from 30-1-1976, ide order dated 22-1-1983. He cited 1971 P L C 47 , 220, P L D 1968 S C 37 and 1975 SCMR 505 . 15. In respect of Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal, Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that he had brought an appeal, alongwith Muhammad Altaf Khan and Muhammad Nazir but had given up its prosecution, without the permission for re-institution of the appeal. According to him, Mr. Iqbal Ratyal is now precluded from bringing another appeal, on the basis of same cause of action. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed argued that in the earlier appeal, before the Tribunal, it was indicated b Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal that he got the information of the order, pertaining t seniority, in May, 1986 whereas he had already submitted the review petition, a ainst order dated 22-1-1983, in February, 1983. In the subsequent appeal, he as taken a different stand from one, taken at the earlier stage. His conduct shows that he was aware of the orders, under appeal, but failed to bring the appeal, at the appropriate time. 16. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate for the respondents also contended that no representation was made by the appellants, against the seniority, proposed by the Secretary Works, in spite of the fact that it was circulated to all concerned. He stated that Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan was promoted as Executive Engineer on 18-4-1983 and held the appointment on acting basis, prior to that. The order of rejection of review petition is stated to have been sent, by the services Department, through the office of Chief Engineer. The appellants had the knowledge of order dated 31-7-1983. He referred to the statement of Muhammad Ashraf and Chaudhry Ali Muhammad, Section Officer examined in this behalf. He argued that if there is a positive evidence, on one side and no rebuttal on the other side, the facts positively alleged should be treated to have been proved. It was stated that copy of order dated 31-7-1983 is shown to have been despatched to Muhammad Ilyas Khan as per entry in the Peon Book, the copy Whereof has been placed on record. The other two appellants were serving in the office of the Chief Engineer. They received the copy of the order personally, without acknowledgment, from the office of Chief Engineer, to which it was despatched by the services Department. The appeals should, therefore, be dismissed as time-barred. He cited the following authorities:- ' P L D 1982 A J& K (S C) 13, 110. ' P L D 1983 S C (AJ&K) 31, ' 1978 SCMR 207 , ' 1979 P L C (C.S.T.) 47, 1986 SCMR 1086 , N L R 1978 Services 157. ' N L R 1979 Services 256, 1985 P L C (C.S.) 951, 1980 P L C (C.S.) 401, 680(2), N L R 1979 Services 208. ' P L D 1974 S C 344 , ' 1978 P L C 77 , 1971 P L C 178 , 1986 SCMRI2, P L ' ' 1977 S C 599 and ' P L D 1979 S C 167. ' He argued that there was no application, for condonation of delay. Under the provisions of section 5, each day's delay is to be explained. 17. Mr. Abdul Rashid, in replication argued that communication of order dated 31-7-1983 or 22-1-1983 is not established. According to him, the limitation does not run, unless an order is communicated to the officer, as envisaged by section 4 of the Service Tribunals Act 1975. He, contended that there is no proof of communication of order to Chaudhry Inayatullah and Igbal Ratyal. He referred to the statement of Sheikh Ghulam Muhammad, Administrative Officer, Electricity Department, who denied the receipt of the spare copies of the order dated 31-7-1983, in Chief Engineer, Electricity's Office, for distribution to the concerned officers. According to the learned counsel, the oral statements of Muhammad Ashraf and Ali Muhammad do not go to prove the communication. He cited 1985 C L C 937, 940 and 1984 C L C 1009. In the matter of competence of appeal, it was stated that no objection was taken in the pleading by the respondent. Apart from that, the promotion of Muhammad Ashraf Khan to the post of Executive Engineer was not made, after considering the appellants, therefore, according to him, the appeal was competent. He cited 1980 C L C 789 to prove that a void order can be ignored. Mr. Abbasi argued that appointment of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin, made on 19-11-1975 was wrongly shown to have been made, on the basis of the Public Service Commission's recommendation. In fact, he had not been approved by the Public Service Commission, rather his name appeared in the merit list. The approval of this officer was given, by the Public Service Commission, in 1978, alongwith other 3 officers. In the merit, he possessed the position, lower than the appellant Chaudhry Inayatullah; hence he should be declared junior. 18. Sardar Rafiq Mahmood, counsel for the appellant Muhammad Ilyas Khan argued that communication of order dated 31-7-1983 is not established. The statements of Mr. Sheikh Ghulam Muhammad and Ali Muhammad, witnesses produced by the parties contradicted each other's statements, hence a valuable right of appeal cannot be forfeited on the basis of such evidence, which transpires no confidence. He reiterated that seniority should be determined in accordance with the rules, enforced in 1977 as the earlier appointments made on ad hoc basis do not confer any right, for seniority. In the case of Muhammad Ashraf Khan, it was argued hat benefit of NPS-17 allowed to him was also a case of promotion, which was n t regular. He cited 1987 P L C 144 to show that up-gradation of post amounts to promotion and requires the approval of prescribed selection authority, which was lacking in this case. 19. We have considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties. The case of seniority inter se Chaudhry Inayatullah, Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Mushtaq Ahinad Gorsi is simple. Their case was considered by the Public Service Commission at one and the same meeting and recommended for appointment. The appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Chaudhry Inayatullah was made again t clear vacancies on 28-9-1978. Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was absorbed on work charge basis but after creation of a post, he was also given a retrospective benefit of regular appointment from 28-9-1978. Thus, the date of regular appointment of these 3 officers is one and the same. Under the rules, the appointment on ad hoc basis carries no right for seniority as clearly provided for in rule 23 of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Civil Servants (Appointment and Conditions of Service Rules) 1977, reproduced below:- "23.- (1) When a post is required to be filled, the Appointing Authority shall fo and a requisition to the Selection Authority, immediately after deci ion is taken to fill the post. (2) Afte forwarding a requisition to the Selection Authority, the Appointing Aut ority may, if it considers necessary in the Public interest, fill the post on d hoc basis for a period not exceeding six months pending nom nation of a candidate by the Selection Authority: ' Provided (i) .................................. (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) ' Provided further that ad hoc appointment shall not confer any right on the ersons so appointed in the matter of regular appointment to the sam post nor the service will count towards seniority in the grade." The appointment of these 3 officers was ad hoc/workcharge in view of their appointment 'order as well as on the face of section 9 of the Public Service g Commission Ordinance. The regular appointment was made after enforcement of the rules, framed in 1977. The relevant provision governing their seniority is embodied in rule 8, which is reproduced below:- "8. The seniority inter se of persons appointed to post in the same grade in a Functional Unit shall be determined:- (1) (a) In the case of persons appointed by initial recruitment, in accordance with the order of merit, assigned by the Selection Authority; ' Provided that persons, selected for appointment to the grade in an earlier selection shall rank senior to the persons selected in a later selection;" In view of the contents of rule 8, the seniority inter se of these 3 officers will be determined o the basis of merit, assigne.d by the Selection Authority namely; the C Public Service Commission. We have also examined the record of the Public Service Commission, as well as the Government order dated 28-9-1978, whereby the regular appointments of these officers were made. The Government had by this order accepted the recommendations of Public Service Commission, without any deviation. He sequence in the order of appointment, which conforms to the merit, assigned on 11-6-1978 by Public Service Commission, is as under:-(1) Inayatullah Chaudhry. (2) Mr. Iqbal Mohi-ud-Din. (3) Mr. Muhammad Ilyas. (4) Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi. 20. The Government appears to have fallen in error in assuming that only a period of 6. Months' service is to be treated as ad hoc, thereafter it was regular, even. Without the approval of the prescribed Selection Authority. This is a wrong interpretation of Rule 13. A decision of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Supreme Court in the case of Rafiq Akhtar Chaudhry P L D 1982 AJ&K (S C) 124 is also misconstrued in this respect. Actually, the Supreme Court opined that after expiry of 6 months, any civil servant cannot be deprived of his appointment, without show-cause notice. This Tribunal has already turned down the case of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi, for the purpose of. Seniority, on the basis of ad hoc appointment. It is lawful for the Government to appoint the Civil servants, on any terms and conditions, it likes. The appointment of Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi was subject to the approval of Public Service Commission. The appointment of Muhammad Ilyas was on workcharge basis, prior to 28-9-1978. All appointments made after 24th day of August, 1974 and before coming into force of Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules without reference to Public Service Commission, were also declared ad hoc. Therefore, the appointment of any of these officers, prior to 28-9-1978 does not bestow any right for seniority. It was lawful for the Government to confirm any person in service, from an earlier date, from which such officer held any appointment, on officiating basis. No such confirmation order appears to have been ever passed in respect of any of these officers. The contention Of Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate, for assigning seniority from any earlier date, except the cases covered by Explanation to Rule 7(1) does not fit in the scheme of service laws applied in Azad Kashmir. The presumption of confirmation cannot be drawn, without specific order. Therefore, the order of merit is the only criteria available, for determination of their inter se seniority. We, therefore, accordingly hold that inter se seniority of these 3 officers shall be determined as under:- (1) Inayatullah Chaudhry. (2) Muhammad Ilyas Khan. (3) Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi. 21. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, the provisions of section 9(a) do not apply in the sense in which their application is possible in the case of other 3 officers. Section 9(a) and (b) is reproduced below:- "9(a)All persons recruited without reference to the Commission to the posts prescribed under section 7 at any time between twenty-fourth day of August, 1974 and coming into force of the Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules framed immediately after promulgation of this Ordinance, shall be deemed to be ad hoc appointments and the post held by any such person shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, within such period, not exceeding six months, as may be fixed by the Government by a special or general order; (b) Aft recruitments other than those mentioned in clause (a) to the posts piiescribed under section 7 at any time between twenty-fourth day of August, 1974, and coming into force of the Public Service Commission (finctions) Rules framed immediately after promulgation of this Ordinance shall be referred to the Commission and if in the opinion of the Commission, a person recruited to any such post, is not fit to hold that post, he may be discharged from service;" ' The appointment, vide order dated 19-11-1975 was not made subject to any condition in the order. His case is not of "Appointment without reference to Public Service Commission" so it comes under subsection (b) of section 9 of Public Service Commission Ordinance and had been alyeady examined by the Public Service Commission. His name appeared in the merit list of the candidates, for the post of Assistant Engineer, Electricity, prepared by the Public Service Commission, in 1974. The cases of officers, who were appointed to service after reference to Public Service Commission even though they were not recommended by the Commission, were to be referred only for the purpose of determination of suitability. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin was not declared ad hoc, through the order of his appointment, nor any rule, requiring the approval of Public Service Commission was applicable on the relevant date namely; 19-11-1975. The Public Service Commission Ordinance enforced later on, only enjoins upon the authority, concerned to have the suitability of these officers, determined afresh, through Public Service Commission. Therefore, such officer could not be deprived of his seniority, as he was found suitable by the Public Service Co mission, at the later stage. The requirement of subsection (b) of section 9 o Public Service Commission Ordinance (which has now become an Act of the ssembly) was complied with. This officer thus stands confirmed in service, on the basis of the order of his appointment and the provisions of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance from the date, he joined the service. He was rightly placed in seniority, above the 3 officers, whose case has been discussed in paragraph 20 of this judgment. 22. It will not be out of place to mention that the constitution of the Commission, which examined the cases on 23rd and 24th July, 1974 was not in dispute. That was lawfully constituted Commission. The Commission, which was constituted subsequently was not lawfully constituted as per opinion of the Supreme Court. There was no legislation, regarding Public Service Commission. On promulgation of Public Service Commission Ordinance, actually the appointments made on the recommendations of the subsequent disputed Commission were to be re-examined, but due to bad drafting of the Ordinance, even the cases wherein the appointment orders on the recommendations of the earlier Comknission were issued after 24-8-1974 were also hit by the provisions of section 9(b). Otherwise there is no justification, for referring the cases, which were considered by the Commission, lawfully constituted. Thus, the reexamination of case of Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin and others, which came up for consideration, before the Public Service Commission, even prior to 24-8-1974, was not necessary and should not have been brought within the miss-chief of subsection (13) of section 9. Position of the cases considered by the subsequent Commission is distinguishable that this Commission was constituted without the lawful authority of the President. 23. In the case of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, assuming that he holds continuous appointment from 1-7-1976, the date from which he is receiving his emoluments and performing duty, in the Electricity Department, he is still senior to the appellant Chaudhry Inayatullah as well as to Sardar Muhammad Ilyas Khan. His case is also not of ad hoc appointment, in view of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance, nor under the rules, enforced in 1977 because he was already holding the post in NPS-17 in the Planning and Development Department, when he was transferred to Electricity Department. The Public Service Commission's Functions Rules, which took effect from 24-8-1974, do not provide for any reference to the Commission, in the matter of transfers to an equal post, rather there is clear exception, for such cases, as is clear from rule 6, which is reproduced below:- "6. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 3, the Commission shall not conduct test for recruitment to posts which are filled- (i) (ii) ...................................................... (a) ............... (b) ............... (iii) by transfer of an officer of the Armed Forces or an officer already holding a post on regular basis in equivalent grade under the Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council or under the Federal or Provincial Government of Pakistan." ' The transfer of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, even if held to have taken effect from 1-7-1976, requires no action at the hands of Public Service Commission. His approval by Public Service Commission in 1981 and the issuance of another order in his case on 20-1-1982 are superfluous. He cannot be deprived of his service for the purpose of seniority from 1-7-1976. The claim of M/s. Muhammad Ilyas Khan and Chaudhry Inayatullah, who hold regular appointment with effect from 28-9-1978, merits no consideration. It is not necessary to discuss the nature of appointment of Muhammad Ashraf in the Electricity Department, which had originated on 15-7-1974, while disposing of the appeals of Chaudhry Inayatullah and Mr. Ilyas Khan. His position, in the impugned order shall, therefore, remain undisturbed so far as the appellants are concerned. On other hand, his case for seniority from 15-7-1974 merits consideration. 24. Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Ratyal has also brought an appeal against the orders dated 22-1-1983 and 31-7-1983. He had brought an appeal, jointly with Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, on 1-6-1986 but later on, he applied for the withdrawal of that appeal on 4-2-1987. His name thus, stood struck off, from the appellants, in that appeal, from the aforesaid date. He did not seek permission of this Tribunal, for bringing fresh appeal. It was argued by Khawaja Muhammad Saeed that he is precluded from bringing another appeal, for seniority against Muhammad Ashraf Khan, who was also a party in the previous case. Mr. Abdul Rashid Abbasi argued that Mr. Iqbal Ratyal had a right of appeal, after issuance of order dated 22-1-1983 as well as after order dated 31-7-1983. The earlier appeal was brought against order dated 22-1-1983 and not against order datdd 31-1-1983, therefore, his right against order dated 31-7-1983 is not extinguished. We have noticed that the Appeal No, 320, dated 1-6-1986 was brought by Mr. Iqbal Ratyal, jointly with Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Kh when both the orders had been already passed. The cause of action against or er dated 22-1-1983 as well as order dated 31-7-1983 is the same. The facts cons ituting seniority of the 2 officers are same, for calling in question the order dat d 22-1-1983 as well as order dated 31-7-1983. The mere fact that another order was passed on 31-7-1983 has not given Mr. Iqbal Ratyal a right, for seniority, nor it has improved his status, in this matter. He could avail of a remedy, either against order dated 22-1-1983 or after waiting for the result of his review petition, he could come with an appeal against order dated 31-7-1983. No second appeal on the same facts is maintainable, in respect of which a case was closed at an earlier stage. The fact that the order dated 31-7-1983 was not in his knowledge is no ground to reopen a matter, which stands closed. The stand taken by the appllant, regarding the knowledge in respect of order dated 22-1-1983 is also contradictory. In the earlier appeal, he stated that he got the information of order dated 22-1-1983 in May, 1986 whereas in the second appeal, he stated that order dated 22-1-1983 came to his knowledge in February, 1983. In fact, he had concealed he fact of his knowledge in the earlier appeal. On being opposed by respondent Muhammad Ashraf Khan, on this point, he realized his weakness and gave up the appeal, for paving out a way for coming up with a different stand with respect to order dated 22-1-1983. Whether a case is decided on merit or disposed of on technical basis, it puts an end to the controversy between the parties. The act of giving up of the earlier appeal by Mr. Iqbal Ratyal has put an end to his right for a remedy, through the Service Tribunal. His appeal, therefore, merits dismissal. Of course, this order will not stand in his way, if the case of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf is dealt with in any other way, in the appeal of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, by the other bench of the Service Tribunal, before which that case is pending. The decision in that case about the nature of appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf will operate, even in the case of Mr. Iqbal Ratyal, because the appointment of these 3 officers has been made on the same date and their case is inseparable. -25. Mr. Iqbal Mohiuddin has not challenged the date of appointment of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, nor any other officer, having a patent case of seniority, against this officer has come up with an appeal against him, therefore, it is not necessary to discuss the date from which Mr. Muhammad Ashraf is entitled to seniority, in this department. Even otherwise his case is complicated and needs interpretation of 'Art. 24, K.S.R., the effect of Public Service Commission Functions Rules and the effect of repeal of Rules of Business 1971. The Court is not supposed to decide a matter, the determination of which is not necessary for the disposal of a case, before it. The term Ratio Decidendi has been discussed by the Azad Jmmu and Kashmir, S.C. In this respect, in the case of Raja Muhammad Ni Khan v. Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government. This matter can be exa coed in detail in an appropriate case, whether for the purpose, his seniority should be determined, with effect from 15-7-1974, the date of his first appointment in the department or from 1-7-1976 from which he holds the continuous appointment. The entry shown in respect of service of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf in the impugned order, therefore, needs no change at this stage. As a result, the position of Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Iqbal Mohiuddin and Muhammad Rashid shall remain the same, as incorporated in the Government order dated 22-1-1983. Chaudhry Inayatullah, Muhammad Ilyas and Mushtaq Ahmad Gorsi shall stand at S.Nos. 3, 4 and 5 respectively. 26. Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate for the respondents had made casual remarks in respect of appointment of Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan and Igbal' Ratyal to show that their appointments were also not regular and require examination, by Public Service Commission, as envisaged by subsection (b) of section 9 of the Public Service Commission Ordinance. The appointment order dated 1-12-1974, passed in the case of the aforesaid 3 officers is not subject of appeals, before us. It has been otherwise argued as well as noticed by us that their cases were considered by Public Service Commission, although the recommendations of Public Service Commission, made in 1974 were not accepted, in toto, by the President, who was the Appointing Authority, in the case of Assistant Engineers, Electricity, at the relevant time. The worthy President, after the receipt of the recommendations, laid down yard-stick of his own, in the following form, as there were no departmental service rules, at that time:- (a) The persons employed on work-charge basis, in the department shall be preferred, for regular appointment to all others; (b) the persons. Who were out of employment, will be preferred to those, who are having appointment in other departments. ' On the basis of the aforesaid principle, Mr. Nazir Ahmad Mir, Muhammad Altaf Khan and Iqbal Ratyal already working in the departments were appointed. Thus, the recommendations of Public Service Commission stood, overruled to this extent. So far as the requirement of Public Service Commission Ordinance is concerned, it needs no discussion, because no person has come up with a claim, through appropriate proceedings, for seniority against these 3 officers. The Tribunal is not supposed to give finding on an issue, not brought before it, in due process of law. The observation of the learned counsel has, therefore, no bearing with this case. In the matter of Iqbal Mohiuddin, we have already given our view, in the earlier part of this judgment, in response to the arguments of the learned counsel. 27. In the matter of limitation, we considered the arguments of Khawaja Muhammad Saeed, Advocate, for the respondents. The impugned order dated 31-7-1983 purports to have been despatched to all concerned but it does not show the address, on which it was communicated to the officers. No presumption of service, therefore, arises either under C.P.C. Or Evidence Act, in such a case. Ali Muhammad, Section Officer, Services Department stated that the copies of the order were despatched to the Chief Engineer, Electricity but no proof of the further service of the letter, on Mr. Inayatullah Chaudhry and Iqbal Mohiuddin has been adduced. Mr. Muhammad Ilyas Khan is shown to have received the copy of the order through some peon. The photostat copy of the peon book has been produced, but it is not corroborated by the Despatch Register of Chief Engineer's Office. Even if one appeal succeeds on merits, in the matter of seniority, the other persons, whose case is not separable, cannot be deprived of the result. No contradictory decisions can co-exist, in one and the same case. In order to avoid contradiction, even under Order XLI, Rule 33, C.P.C. a decree can be passed, in favour of a party, who has not appealed against a judgment, as held by our High Court, in the case Ghulam Hussain v. Asila Begum P L D 1978 AJ&K 1 . For these reasons, the appeal of Mr. Ilyas Khan cannot be dismissed on the ground of Ahmad Mir and Muhammad Altaf Khan, due to identical facts. His appeal merits dismissal, On the ground of withdrawal of earlier appeal. The objection, with regard to the limitation, therefore, does not sustain. The case law cited by the learend counsel for the parties has been perused but it dOes not require discussion, in detail, for the view, we have taken. 28 As upshot of the above discussion, the appeal of Mr. Iqbal Ratyal is dismissed. The appeals of Chaudhry Inayatullah and Muhammad Ilyas Khan are accepted to the extent, indicated above. The Governmetn shall maintain seniority, as indicated in paragraphs 19 and 25 of this judgment. There is no order as to the COST.
