For reference relevant part of Show-Cause Notice dated 19.12.2022 is reproduced as under:- "During scrutiny of tax record of M/s. Rehmani Dawakhana bearing NTN 2582376-7 has declared turnover of Rs.94,200,316/- in its income tax returns for tax period July, 2019 to June, 2021, rendering him liable for sales tax registration and payment of sales tax on supplies under the above provision of law.

From the above, it is evident that the show-cause notice is totally silent and has not mentioned any allegation as have been mentioned in the said order. The CIR(A) also noticed the illegality in and mentioned it on page No.10 of his order and in this regard he wrote letter to seek opinion of department however, no appeared on behalf of department. It appears that the order has been passed beyond the show-cause notice.

The proceedings initiated on the basis of illegal notices and superstructure constructed thereon in the shape of amended order under section 11(2) is nullity in law. 7. Keeping in view the facts of the present case and the above contentions, we have no hesitation in holding that the order dated 13.04.2023 is beyond the show-cause notice dated 19.12.2022 in the case of the taxpayer appellant is not sustainable in the eyes of law. Once we have held that the show-cause notice was defective, the consequences thereof are the super structure built thereon cannot be sustained either.
