At The very outset, a question was put to The learned counsel for The appellants that how These Intra Court Appeals are competent in view of proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 of The Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. They contended that The impugned orders passed by The learned Single Judge in Chambers are illegal and unlawful.

We have heard The learned counsel for The appellants at great length and examined The record. 4.

Admittedly The original orders have been passed by The Returning Officers eiTher rejecting or accepting The nomination papers against which an appeal is provided under Sub-rule (10) of Rule 14 of The Punjab Local Government (Conduct of Elections) Rules, 2013. Therefore, These Intra Court Appeals are not competent, as law applicable has provided one appeal against such orders under proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 of The Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. Reference may be made to case titled Mst. Karim Baksh and oThers vs. Hussain Bakhsh and anoTher ( PLD 1984 SC 344 ). Reference may also be made to unreported order dated 12.10.2015 passed in I.C.A.
