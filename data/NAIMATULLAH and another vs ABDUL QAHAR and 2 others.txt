After remand of the case, learned Judge under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000, convicted and sentenced the private respondents, in the manner herein-below mentioned:â€” "Thus, in the light of above, the accused Abdul Qahar is convicted and sentenced under Section 302(b) readwith 34 PPC for life imprisonment as Ta'zir for commission of murder of deceased Bibi Robiqa and also ordered to pay Rs, 100,000/- (Rupees one Lac only) as compensation to the legal heirs of deceased Bibi Robiqa in view of Section 544-A Cr.P.C. In default of payment, accused further will suffer SI for six (6) months. However, accused Abdul Qahar has committed Zina-bil-Jabr of Ta'zir with deceased Mst. Robiqa as 1 have discussed hereinbefore, while admittedly accused is a minor, therefore, he is convicted and sentenced under Section 7 read with Section 10 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance, 1979 for a period of five years RI and fine of Rs, 5000/-, in default of fine, accused further will suffer SI for one (1) year.

However, benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is extended in favour of both the accused and the period, which accused have spent as under trial prisoners be deducted from their original sentences." Against aforementioned judgment, present petition for enhancement of sentence has been filed. We have heard Mr. Azizullah Kakar, learned counsel for petitioners. During course of arguments, it was pointed out that the matter was remanded by this Court vide judgment dated 23rd May, 2005 to the Juvenile Court by holding that the private respondents are covered under Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000; the said judgment was accepted by all concerned and after remand of the case, the learned Juvenile Court has passed the maximum sentence provided by the law. It was pointed out to the learned counsel that how this petition for enhancement of sentence to that of death penalty is covered in view of above Ordinance. Learned counsel has not been able to properly answer the same. However, it is beneficial to reproduce Section-12 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000, herein-below:-- "12. Orders that shall not be passed with respect to a child.-- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law for the time being in force no child shall be-- (a) awarded punishment of death, or ordered to labour during the time spent in any Borstal or such other institution; and (b) handcuffed, put in fetters or given any corporal punishment at any time while in custody: Provided that where there is reasonable apprehension of the escape of the child from custody, he may be handcuffed." The above provision of law clearly provides that the respondents--accused being Juvenile, cannot be awarded punishment of death. Similarly, they cannot be ordered to labour etc. In view of the clear bar contained in, the law, which is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case, the present petition for enhancement of sentence is not competent in law. The Legislature has clearly provided the maximum punishment for the juveniles, who are covered under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. In such circumstances of the case, the petition for enhancement of sentence to death, is not maintainable, and thus; the same is dismissed in limine. www.eastlaw.pk Disclaimer: While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and currency, we do not guarantee completeness, correctness, or applicability to specific cases of court judgments available on this website.
