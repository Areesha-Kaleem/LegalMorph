The appellant argued that he was senior and entitled to the post.",
  "investigation_summary": "The appellant filed a representation against Respondent No. 3's promotion, which was partly accepted, leading to his own promotion as Deputy Director on 1973-06-26. However, he remained dissatisfied and filed an appeal seeking cancellation of Respondent No. 3's promotion, which had occurred on 1973-06-02.",
