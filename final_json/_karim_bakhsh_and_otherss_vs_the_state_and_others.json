  "complaint_summary": "Petitioners sought adjustment of their share in Khata Shamlat No. 127, claiming entitlement based on Jamabandi entries of 1949-50. Respondents argued that shamlat rights were tied to wells assessed during the Settlement of 1878-80.",
  "investigation_summary": "The case involved examination of settlement records from 1878-80, 1901-02, and 1921-22, along with Jamabandi entries from 1949-50. Petitioners argued inconsistency in revenue assessment criteria across settlements, while respondents maintained that shamlat rights were tied to wells assessed during the First Regular Settlement.",
  "judgment_summary": "The court held that the petitioners' land was not assessed to land revenue during the First Regular Settlement of 1878-80, making them ineligible for adjustment in Khata Shamlat No. 127. Entries in Misl Haqiyat of 1921-22 superseded earlier records, and disuse of wells did not extinguish shamlat rights. The revision petition was dismissed, with parties to bear their own costs.",

    "Petitioners argued that Shamlat rights should be based on Jamabandi entries of 1949-50 and disuse of wells extinguished respondents' shamlat rights.",
    "Respondents contended that rights were determined by Misl Haqiyat entries of 1921-22, referencing assessments from 1878-80, and disuse of wells did not affect shamlat rights."
