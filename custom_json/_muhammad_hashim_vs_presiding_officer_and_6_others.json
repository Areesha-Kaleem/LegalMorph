  "judgment_excerpt": "The petition has been filed for the quashment of the proceedings pending before the Special Court (Offences in Banks) Sindh at Karachi arising out of F.I.R. No.1/2001. The learned Advocate for the petitioner has stated that he had moved application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. But the trial Court has not decided the same and that the trial Court has no jurisdiction to try the offence. From the above position, it is clear that the petitioner has already invoked the jurisdiction of the trial Court for acquittal of the petitioner. The point of jurisdiction and the application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. Are yet to be decided by the trial Court as such adequate remedy is available with the petitioner which he has already availed. In the circumstances, the trial Court is directed to decide the point of jurisdiction and the application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. Within a period of one month. The petition is disposed of in the above terms.",
