  "reported_as": "1978 P L C (C. S. T.) 55",
  "judgment_excerpt": "Heard Mr. Jamil Khan Sherwani for the appellant and Mohammad Raisani, for the respondents on the preliminary objection that a University Employee is not a civil servant and as such the appeal is not maintainable. Subsection (3) of section 3 of the Baluchistan University Ordinance, 1972 provides that the University shall be a body corporate. Such body has been held by the Supreme Court in P L D 1965 S C 90 as statutory body constituted by the Government in connection with the affairs of the Province. This would naturally imply that an employee of the University is engaged in connection with the affairs of the Province. He will therefore fall within the definition of a 'civil servant' as provided in section 2(a) of the Baluchistan Civil Services Tribunal Act. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain appeals in respect of all matters relating to terms and conditions of service of civil servants of the Province under section 3 of the Baluchistan Civil Servants Act. We are therefore of the view that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal as it has been filed by a civil servant. The preliminary objection is therefore disallowed.",
