    "The High Court clarified that the Explanation to section 263, inserted by the Finance Act, 1988, is retrospective and allows the Commissioner to rely on material available at the time of examination.",
    "Supreme Court judgments affirmed the wide amplitude of section 263, allowing consideration of subsequent material before revisional power is exercised."
